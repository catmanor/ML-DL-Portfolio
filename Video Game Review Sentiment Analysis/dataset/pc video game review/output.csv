Instead of giving the player a vast field of possible events and stories that happened to the character all the time that was outside the pen and the camera ... they sucked drama from their fingers, and threw it as a wet rag in the faces of the players in the form of raw and a crooked product that even a year in 2010 would have been barely on the average rating.The whole game is divided into two locations. Instead of monsters, Sauron's main home is ruled by humans. And what are the primitive and boring quests in the form of pushing the levers and finding the tokens ... main quests, Carl!Enemies are extremely stupid and blind. Graphics are complete crap. Did you see his eyes???The only seemingly interesting thing in this game(the dialogues with alter-ego) is also f***ed up (You are given an icon of what should be supposedly true at the beginning. You are not allowed to complete the set of icons, since there are free slots before the verdict is issued. Decisions do not affect the plot in any way).

54,crime-boss-rockay-city,23-May-23,5,"Good-Gunplay is decent; The strange combination of actors that make up the cast is novel. Bad-Many immersion-breaking bugs; Unbalanced difficulty; Writing and voice acting is seriously bad. Thoughts-To the aging actors’ credits, they aren’t given much to work with in terms of writing. The story is structured and presented as an early 90s action film, perhaps as a means of making the younger versions of its now aged cast make more sense, but it unfortunately also has all of the poor representation, objectification, and ham-fisted dialogue those movies are known for, And not even in a fun way. There is also a forced attempt to be “wacky” that doesn’t do the game any favors. A scattered number of scenes and lines elicited a singular chuckle from me, but the vast majority of those were thanks to the comical disinterest you can hear in Chuck Norris’ voice as he patronizes you about how you messed up your run.",Average

57,crime-boss-rockay-city,28-Apr-23,9,"Crime Boss is basically a rogue lite with less focus on additional multiplayer elements. There are some problems, like with the AI, but overall I find it very enjoyable. I think of the game as a light version of Payday giving off GTA vibes but very different with its separated missions. Crime Boss has some good gimmicks and bad ones like a bad random event starting missions in middle of a firefight. Some of the AI actions will frustrate players as well but overall I'm very happy and I like that the game doesn't take itself too seriously and there is an interesting diverse cast of characters. I'm a little disappointed as some gameplay is getting in the way of completing objectives and I wish there was an option to join a friend's campaign as a hired team member, but overall I am loving the game after tens of hours and plan to continue playing. Crime Boss will offer good options on stealth and customizing your character's weapons but if you're happy with repeating the campaign, interested in how to find out alternative steps to find new missions, and especially if you have someone to try this game with I hope people give it a chance. DLC when?",Positive
58,crime-boss-rockay-city,27-Apr-23,10,Honestly a solid game with interesting features that would definitely create a unique experience through extensive updates or even another game in general. Voice acting is way off but it adds to the charm to me.Gameplay itself is entertaining enough but the thing that keeps me glued is the cycle. I love roguelikes and this was a good experience away from the souls like roguelikes. Not perfect but there is alot here in teems of foundation. Doesn't deserve the hate it's getting. Please update and go on.,Positive

60,crime-boss-rockay-city,10-Apr-23,7,"By no means is this a groundbreaking or genre defining game. This is Payday without all the wasted time, and while it doesnt have the depth either, it strips out all the worst parts that come with a deep and confusing meta and replace it with a repeatable rougelike, in which you learn that as frustrating as your mistakes are, very few of them will be detrimental enough to end a run.",Average

There are too many bugs, the gameplay looks ""old"", there are some very funny cinematics and others that are boring where they do nothing( only talk all the time looking one character at the other...) The positive part is the price, iconic characters, and some hilarious cinematics. Right now I would not recommend it.",Negative

Yes the voice acting sounds a but rough but besides that I can't really tell you any bad experience I've had with the game. It's been nothing but pure fun and joy. I love the funny corny jokes they make and just all around how not serious the game is. I definitely suggest buying it if you like games that are extremely corny and not to be taken seriously. The game is fine in all aspects except the voice acting don't let these big companies full you into thinking the game is bad just because they didn't get a pay check to say the game was good. You can join any twitch stream and see people having an absolute blast playing the game for what it is.

Some you can sign for free while the other characters with better stats will cost money.The optimization needs work, if you enjoy your fps games this one is a guilty pleasure.

68,crime-boss-rockay-city,2-Apr-23,4,"I heard about this game in December 2022, and since the trailer was so well done, I was eagerly anticipating it with hope and joy... Let me say straight away that my hopes were pretty much dashed in less than 2 hours of gameplay. After completing the tutorial and making progress in the campaign, my verdict on the single-player experience is extremely mixed. It's very reminiscent of Payday 2 (at this point, one could even call it plagiarism) in remastered 2023, which means it's graphically pumped up on steroids and simplified to the extreme in terms of management and gameplay. The campaign feels like a dud, the kind of high-budget Hollywood action movie that's overacted by the actors and in which you participate in a few action scenes that are ultimately pointless. The budget seems to have been absorbed by the cast, which may be the only positive aspect of the game when it's forgotten in 6 months. There's no creativity in the gameplay or the story; it's all very basic. The actors overplay their parts, it's a real flop. However, it could become a cult classic, and at times I wondered if the entire scripted part was meant to be a big joke. What a waste for these good '90s action stars who seem lost in this production. But let's get back to the gameplay. It's not an open world, you can't explore the city, you can only choose missions in a particular location, and it's always the same: infiltration, action, extraction... In Payday 2, during the extraction phase, we sometimes, or even often, had an accident, and we had to transfer the loot from the crashed van to a new vehicle, which added extra tension at the end of the heist. We never knew if we were going to get away ""easy"" or if we were going to have to face the police again, in the middle of an intersection, next to a park. But there's none of that in Crime Boss. In Rockay City, the cops mind their own business. In short, I'm very disappointed at the moment. As for multiplayer, I get the impression that you can only play with your Epic friends, not with random guys... I still hope that the developers will improve the game in the future or that the rest of the single-player campaign will be better than its beginning. Even though what I've seen is lackluster, the game has considerable potential, and if the developers add the missing features, it could become a reference. In conclusion, here's my advice: if you like Payday 2, stick with it; if you don't like Payday 2, you won't like Crime Boss (it's the same gameplay, with ultra-simplified complexity, wrapped in modern graphics and a poorer story); and if you don't know Payday 2, wait for the third opus, which should come out this year. Today, I give it a 4/10 for the cast, Kim Basinger, the graphics, and the technical execution (I haven't encountered any bugs yet). I'll revise my rating later based on my continued experience with the game.",Negative
69,crime-boss-rockay-city,1-Apr-23,1,"Wasted potential...they may add more content and polish the game later...but atm...Repetitive in all aspects...gameplay without any innovation as you progress + small repetitive environments + too simple management like in some mobile game, leaving you with no motivation to keep playing. Ally and enemy AI is really bad in this game with simple commands and no possibility to create team tactics. Sadly the quality of writing, dialogues and voice acting which was the main selling point for this game is also more on the bad side and not in a good way. Graphics look like 5+ years old game. On top of everything full of bugs and game crashes.Similar to Payday 2, which I would choose atm over this game.",Negative

72,crime-boss-rockay-city,31-Mar-23,8,"When you actually play the game, it is surprisingly fun. Don’t get me wrong, there are issues with writing, gameplay variety - but some of these could be improved in updates. One of the biggest issues is that developers don’t properly explain all game elements and mechanics. Fun came when you understand how to play this game. For example  reviewers criticizing stealth probably don’t know all options they have. In addition to stealth takedowns (which are unreliable sometimes), you can disable cameras and then use shouting + zip-tying for crowd control, which is applicable also to guards.Campaign have novel ideas and is both challenging and fun. I like rogue-like elements, not enough variability and writing is the biggest issue. I hope there will be higher difficulty available.FPS part is not good nor bad. AI and weapon impacts (injuries) could be better.Multiplayer is great with friends (as in other coop games), I really enjoyed concept of unlocking unique characters by playing chains for 3 stars. My biggest issue is again lack of variety and in this case also long term progression.Final words - I would give harsher review if this game is for full price. Current price is more than adequate for 8+ hours I have spent in this game.",Positive

There is a stealth mechanics but no matter what you do, it ends like a shootout. Playing campaign with dumb bots as your teammates is really painful. AI of the enemies is really bad. It feels like youre shooting some zombies with guns. Gunplay itself is otherwise ok.Even in multiplayer, you play CO-OP against these dumb AI enemies, which is not very entertaining. I dont understand why cant you play story campaign in CO-OP. This is just lazy.Rogue-like mechanics in the single player mode is supposed to be one the selling points of this game. Problem is, the missions are so repetetive, you probably wouldnt want to play this game over and over again.Story, cinematics, voice acting is extremly bad.  Such a waste, with cast like this. I dont reccomend this game, even considering lower price with discount.",Negative
74,crime-boss-rockay-city,30-Mar-23,8,"A interesting GTA clone that will probably come onto consoles later. As for the game, I say it’s decently good.",Positive
75,crime-boss-rockay-city,30-Mar-23,2,"Such wasted potential. This was supposed to be that game that isn't totally great, but is a guilty pleasure like the 1990 action movies. But it's been a terrible disappointment. The actors are the main attraction, but they don't act, they recite lines that are extremely boring, with no ideas and not a shred of humor. Except for Michael Rooker who at least tried. Which is a big shame because we know that games can incorporate real actors well see Keanu Reeves, Christopher Judge etc. and it's a breath of fresh air to games. Gameplay is boring, repetitive, no fun, frustrating. In two hours you get to the same area in multiple missions, but the difference is the safe is in a different location and there are more enemies. The AI in the game just doesn't exist. You have partners who do absolutely nothing and 20 cops charging at you headlong. No tactics, no stealth gameplay (you can try, but it still usually turns into a headless gunfight) The rogue-like element is interesting, but not in this game. If you play 6-8 hours and then have to do it all over again, same lame dialogue, same missions. The idea of a 4 minute mission is interesting, but not so much when you then have to click through the menu for crap and spend another 5-10 minutes there. Then Dialogue, mission, menu and repeat over and over again. The cinematography is terrible, where you jump from actor to actor and the feeling is bad. The music is well chosen but poorly used. There is so much music in the 90's and they only pick six licensed ones. One of the few things that isn't so bad is gun play. Not excellent, but good. Maybe a couple of missions where you don't steal are mildly interesting We'll see what the developers and studio do with those problems. At the moment it's a lot worse payday, but even payday wasn't in the best shape in the very beginning and it took a while to get it to where it is today, so maybe there's hope for Crime Boss, but there's a long way to go. In current state, this game simply cannot be recommended.",Negative
76,crime-boss-rockay-city,30-Mar-23,8,"So I just brought the game and i like it. Yes its so bad that its actually good. It has some potential to be good only if they spent more time on gameplay and not the cast. The cast is a dream but the voice acting is terrible. Especially Chuck Norris who gives the worst voice acting ever in a video game. I would have rather Steven Segal but even he would give something worst so I can deal with Chuck Norris but he's very cringe. Michael Madsen is okay but they should have gotten actual video game voice actors. I feel they could have just gotten the likeness from these people and have actually voice actors like how they did in Scarface: The World Is Yours. Just get the likeness and have better voice actors. Madsen sounds like smokey the bear smoked 30 packs of cigarettes per hour. The combat is okay but could be better. I feel that all FPS' should be like COD or Battlefield, weapons have too much recoil. I understand that guns in real life have recoil as I have shot a 9mm and 7.52x51mm rifle so I know those guns go bam. But its overexaggerated in this game. Guns are hard to control. I haven't had any bugs or glitches so far. The tutorial was very helpful as I am using a controller for this run and I'll do my KBM for my next. The permadeath is exciting and makes you be more cautions with how you move in the game. Can't go all Rambo which is good. But you lose health too quickly which isn't something I like. I feel like they could have did it like COD with no health bar and like Uncharted.  They should have made it open world and added a TPS view. There is so much potential here but they needed to at least delay the game till next year. Cast is great but they needed to spend more time on the gameplay. I do like this game so I am giving it an 8 because it does have some good things about it.",Positive

It isn't open world or anything profound, but it is a really fun and interesting game worth the $30 I spent to get it.

86,crime-boss-rockay-city,30-Mar-23,3,"This game was a huge disappointment, the co-op mode is basically pointless and has no real progression, except unlocking more missions, which are all the same. If you're looking for a good co-op game with decent progression and various unlocks, this is definitely not the game for you. The single-player is somewhat better, but it just felt really bland and uninspired to me.",Negative
87,crime-boss-rockay-city,30-Mar-23,7,"Although certainly rough around the edges now, Crime Boss is an otherwise interesting and fun single-player oriented take on the PAYDAY formula, offering both cooperative heists and a dedicated single-player roguelite campaign. Pros: + A full-fledged roguelite story mode revolving around taking over the Miami-inspired city, offering turf war elimination matches, heists to finance our criminal empire, and some occasional scripted story missions. The available opportunities (and muscles to hire) slightly differ with each playthrough, offering a slightly different experience for each run, even though the roguelite gameplay basics remain the same. During each run, our protagonist gains XP, unlocking new skills with each level up, making subsequent runs slightly easier to progress through by buffing our protagonist, our gang's cash flow and general strength, or the quality of equipment and muscle we can buy. + The two co-op modes are also serviceable, with Quick Play being similar to the Crime.NET screen of PAYDAY2 (offering the same heists we encounter in Story Mode in a standalone fashion), while Urban Legends being more akin to the multi-day heists of PAYDAY2 and the grand heists of GTA Online, each spanning three levels. + Some minor gameplay enhancements compared to PAYDAY2. For example, we can temporarily speed up the speed of our drills, or can unlock doors via dedicated minigames. We can also carry up to two loot bags at the same time, although in that case, we are restricted to our sidearm. + The visuals are okay, the city really conveys that 90s Florida setting pretty well. + All-around performance is also acceptable. I'm running the game on a rig with a i7-4790 CPU, a GTX 1070 VGA and 32 gigs of RAM, on a 2560x1080 ultrawide resolution, with the High detail preset. With this setting, I only experience some occasional hiccups during larger battles. + AI companions are serviceable, being able to loot the goodies independently, pick up dropped loot bags, or deliver them to the escape van on their own. We can also order them to follow us or stay put, and can seamlessly switch into them whenever needed. Granted, if we want to stealth, they may not be reliable, but they serve the single player campaign well enough. + All-around stealth is easier than it is in PAYDAY2. We have an unlimited amount of zipties and bodybags available, while guards don't wear pagers, so as long we can divert/separate them from other NPCs, it's easy to dominate and tie them up without trouble. We can also move tied NPCs around. Cons: - Writing and voice acting is horrendous. Chuck Norris' performance is probably the worst VA I've ever heard in a video game. Michael Madsen at least tries putting in a performance, but in his case, it's really off-putting to hear a 35-40 years old protagonist talking with the voice of a 65 years old guy. The game also doesn't have separate stealth and loud voice lines, meaning that you dominate guards by shouting at them (undetected) even when in stealth. - Gunplay is serviceable, but could be a lot better. You can't really ""feel"" any of the guns, and most of them feature really annoying bloom - it's hard to land shots even with semi-automatic pistols and rifles. - Lone wolfs might be bothered by the fact that even though you can play the Quick Play and Urban Legends heists solo with bots, you cannot create private lobbies. As such, if you don't fill the slots with bots, others can easily join in. Also, as I understand, the co-op game modes don't have any special rewards, you can only unlock the higher-level characters in them for story play. - Customization is only rudimentary, with each character being able to wield a two-handed weapon, a sidearm, and a special gadget (e.g. a number of throwable rocks or bricks). - Map variety is also not the game's forte, as all three game modes seemingly sharing the same combat map pool of roughly ~two dozen levels, with some minor randomization during each run (affecting guard patrols and camera placement). This, however, could change in the future. Summary: TL;DR, I like the game, and I think it worth the discounted AA price it cost during the preorder campaign, but it can certainly use some additional polish, a redesign of the rudimentary customization features, and extra robbery/heist maps. Still, if you are looking for a primarily single-player PAYDAY experience set in an over-the-top 1990s setting, you can definitely take a look at the game. :)",Average
88,redfall,21-Jul-23,4,"I've played for 8 hours so far, some solo and some co-op. No major bugs, just occasional clipping and a couple of DCs. Looks good, atmospheric, is reasonably good fun to play. Some elements of Far Cry, some of Borderlands, lots of looting like in Warzone. Like in Far Cry 6, the enemies are not especially challenging - AI could use some tweaking. Ignore the haters bandwagon, it may not be the best game ever but I'd say it's a solid FPS that's more about fun than challenge. EDIT:Gave up after 30 hours.

Who doesn't want a vampire shooting game made by Arkane? Unfortunately, reality sunk in during my time playing it... while the gunplay and some mechanics were fun to mess around with, the overall game was just... meh. The story wasn't great and well... the enemies were a bit too easy. The AI would get stuck in places, and the bosses were a ton easier than the normal vamp[ires that circled around the city. The NPCS also just didn't have dialogue unless they were important to the quest line. Most of them would just answer back with grunts and there was one that just straight-up ignores the players. The textures lacked a ton for a next-gen experience and for $70 slideshow cutscenes were definitely the last straw. Thankfully GamePass saved me $70 dollars, this game needed another year or two or just scrapped altogether because it wasn't the hit I thought it would be. Jacob and the gunplay are what save this from going lower on the score.

Redfall is not even sustainable as a substructure to the fun. Why? simple enough. Poor gameplay. Its AI is horrendous. I remember playing smartphone games with smatter enemies than in this game. The skill tree is the definition of a ""modern rpg"", when the abilities do not actually matter and are overinflated to give you a sensation of a lot of content. The inventory is crazy bad. You gain a lot of weapons too fast and the overall experience is unbalanced, even on hard difficulty. Also, there's no need to work together since no actual treat requires that, so the abilities are kinda useless at some point. The only ok thing is the weapons design. Poor story. Most of it is told by static images - this game costs 70$ - and documents. No actual storytelling, I can assure you. NPC dialog? forget it. And how does the narrative influence the gameplay? oh, grab that and that, and that and bring it right here. That's it. Poor optimization. Alright, I'm already used to it since PC ports are usually bad in the generation. As a Ryzen 5 1600 owner, that actually gets worse since my CPU can't take some bad games. Even that, I never saw something run so bad on my PC. Jesus. Constant stuttering and FPS drop. I was playing at 25 fps sometimes, and reducing the graphics quality didn't do anything.

125,redfall,14-May-23,0,"Redial, the highly anticipated release from XYZ Studios, falls far short of its promise and is a prime example of a poorly executed video game. Despite its flashy marketing campaign and initial excitement, Redial fails to deliver on multiple fronts, leaving players frustrated, bored, and ultimately regretful of their purchase. One of the most glaring issues with Redial is its lackluster gameplay mechanics. The controls feel clunky and unresponsive, making even simple tasks a frustrating ordeal. The combat system, which should be a highlight of any action game, is marred by poor hit detection and repetitive animations. Instead of engaging battles that keep players on the edge of their seats, fights in Redial quickly become tiresome and predictable, lacking any depth or strategy. Furthermore, the game's storyline is convoluted and poorly developed. The narrative is riddled with plot holes, inconsistent character motivations, and a complete lack of emotional investment. The dialogue feels forced and unnatural, failing to establish any meaningful connections between the player and the game's world. It's a missed opportunity to create an immersive experience that players can truly get lost in. Visually, Redial is a disappointment as well. The graphics, touted as cutting-edge during the game's promotional campaign, are underwhelming and fail to impress. The environments lack detail and variety, making each level feel monotonous and uninspired. Character models suffer from stiff animations and lackluster design, further detracting from any potential visual appeal. To add insult to injury, Redial is riddled with technical issues. Frequent crashes, game-breaking bugs, and long loading times plague the experience, disrupting any semblance of enjoyment that players might have had. It's evident that the developers rushed the release without adequately addressing these critical problems, leading to a frustrating and unfinished game. Even the sound design in Redial is subpar. The music lacks depth and fails to create the intended atmosphere, often feeling like an afterthought rather than an integral part of the gaming experience. The voice acting, if present at all, is mediocre at best, with unconvincing performances that further contribute to the game's overall lack of immersion. A Disappointing Game Experience In conclusion, Redial is a highly disappointing game that fails to deliver on its promises. With its clunky gameplay mechanics, poorly developed storyline, lackluster visuals, technical issues, and subpar sound design, it's hard to find redeeming qualities in this title. Players are advised to steer clear of Redial and invest their time and money in more polished and engaging gaming experiences available on the market.",Negative

If you know what I mean, you'll know what I mean. I spent £500 on a Series X last year and all I seem to do is play Indie Games that don't need a Series X to run and utter garbage like this for 45 minutes before giving up entirely and heading back to Steam on my PC. DO NOT BUY.",Negative
130,redfall,12-May-23,1,"Redfall, a highly-anticipated looter-shooter, disappoints in every aspect. The lackluster story, weak combat, and technical issues plague the game. While sharing some similarities with other Arkane titles, Redfall's open-world approach lacks imagination and detail. The game fails to showcase the potential of the Xbox Series X, with missions becoming repetitive and tedious. Even the promised unique vampire nests turn monotonous. The final boss fight is underwhelming, reducing the player to a button-masher. Human enemies lack intelligence, and the story unfolds through poorly animated paintings. Redfall is a bafflingly bad vampire shooter that fails to deliver on its promises. (Apparently it'll take me literally forever to post a review on here that I wrote about Redfall.. thanks MetaCritic, fix your website!)",Negative

Saw the abysmal reviews and figured it couldn't be THAT bad/I'd try it for free using Xbox game pass. First of all it runs like dog sh*t. Can't remember anything near as bad as this in terms of performance/frame rate dips, and I played Cyberpunk 2077 at launch. My PC can normally run most games on high+ settings no problem. But there is just not a good game buried under the performance issues. The gun play is simply awful. The world is zero fun to explore, the firefights are also no fun. The gun fights with armed enemies feel like you're playing against a Chinese aimbot hacker in PUBG. The vampire fights are worse. How anyone thought this was acceptable to release is beyond me.

Played using game pass so it was essentially free except the 40 minutes that I'd rather have back in my life. Firstly, none of the character designs were engaging -- literally the first time I looked up what character to use on Google rather than going with what my gut told me, so I played Dev. Mind you, I only played up until the first vampire at which I stopped playing because I was asking myself why I should keep playing, because the game gives you no connection to your character and by extension no connection to the plot. The first cut-scene is entirely unrelated to you or your character. I also don't understand what the music is trying to express at any point.

This reminds me so much of Fallout 76.  The game has launched (like 76) with a host of really debilitating and frustrating bugs and graphical glitches, but the world looks top notch.  Character design also took a hit... looking plain awful if you ask me.  There are far too many problems bogging down Redfall to name here in a brief review (nobody will read)... but there is a slim chance... a glimmer of hope really... that this games most serious shortcoming could be resolved, and there's and even smaller chance the game could be good someday.  In the meantime... the world space is fun enough to just romp around in once with Game Pass, or another subscription.  I wouldn't pay $70 for this game... let alone $100+ for a premium version with a bunch of totally unnecessary cosmetics.  I will say this:  It's pretty obvious the game was going to have some kind of MTX or battle passes or something... it has that kind of a stink on it... which is really bizarre since... that's the not the game that was released.

First of all lets talk about a significant part of the game and it is surprize surprize is bugs (nowadays it probably standard that game has some issues but this game has a lot of). in this game you can meet ""t-pose"" of characters and enemies, AI is also kinda broken that enemies on the location completely ignoring player, a lot of visual bugs with light system and LOD. And what interesting without this bugs game will stay OK and it perfect word to describe this game it kinda enjoyable and nothing more, game doesn't contain anything that can be eye catching or memorized. Yeah its co op open world but it feels kinda empty for it size and it really not so big. weapon system is also kinda strange some weapons has sub stats that can improve it stats but game doesn't show the base stats so message as increasing acc by 10% is kinda meaningless. Plot is also interest part of this game i mean it interest that devs also decide to save some money on cutscenes so it static pictures with copyright free music (at least it feels like it actually free). furthermore structure of the game looks like developers want to artificially stretch the playing time by make system like: open shelter, kill 3 minor boss to be able to kill mid level boss after you can do the same thing two more times and only after it you be able to kill final boss that actually can be killed by pressing F button 3 times. So who can enjoy this game ? probably someone who has gamepass to play it cheaper than 70$ and that person already completed every game on his list and just want to skip two evenings with his friend.for everyone else i don't think it that experience that expect player that saw ""from the creator of dishonored and prey"" in every trailer and price in 70$.",Negative

The Graphics are Breathtaking and make games like Horizon : Forbidden West or The Last of Us Part 1/2 look like PS3 games. The Details are amazing and the Gunplay is some of the best i've ever seen. The AI is stellar. The Story is left me Breathless throughout the entire game with very interesting twist and turns. This clearly there magnum opus and i have no idea how they can beat it. Redfall has some of the best Level Design you will ever seen. This is by far the best Game Arkane has ever made its one of the most detailed OW games i've seen in my Life.

216,redfall,3-May-23,0,"Welp I won't lie by saying that the first time we saw the game being revealed, nobody was thinking this would be GOTY material. Still, Arkane Studios produced amazing games, even if none were 10 out of 10 (at least in my opinion). So let's start with this. First of all, I've refunded the game within the two hours I played it on Steam for a few reasons. Trying to play with a friend was a nightmare, not the one sold by the studio's sales pitches. Being disconnected on both sides, being logged out from the Arkane server, and the game simply crashing. When we manage to play for a little bit, we've met some of the wonkiest IA that even The Elder Scrolls couldn't fight for the crown. Either they just didn't bother attacking us, they ended up being iddle while being killed, or, worst scenario, they got stuck in an unkillable death loop (hehe, see the pun?) Sorry). The NPC weren't any better when it was possible to see them or when they weren't trying to intimidate us while t-posing. The last thing that bothered us (at least me) was that we ended up in his game and noticed that he was the only one being able to progress his save (MAJOR BUZZ KILL). So yeah, I went to look forward to playing at being horribly disappointed and lacking any faith when this was supposed to be a finished product that was pushed back to make sure everything was fine. It could have easily been released a year after the release today, and maybe, just maybe, it would have been a great game with the signature of Arkane magic. Clearly, this time the only magical moment I encountered was the moment my refund was allowed right away via Steam refund. All I can say is that not being able to play the game without issues every 5–10 minutes makes it impossible to review and even give a point to this. Arkane Studios (or Microsoft, I don't care who to blame TBH) deserve that massive L from the players to understand that releasing a product in such poor condition is not acceptable today, no matter if the game can be rented via Game Pass (which I love being a sub for from time to time) or paid the full price (like I did since I love to own my game). We have so many options today, from F2P games that are sometimes better than AAA games to indies to obviously major releases from big box stores, so how the hell did they think this was something that people wouldn't hold on to? Welp, this deserves a big zero, and I sure hope they'll move forward and fix the games with at least an apology to people who wanted to support them and enjoy a brand new IP. This will most likely be their last attempt at creating a brand new game. I have that feeling. Con's Horrible optimisation (even with a 11700k and RTX3080)Always onlineNo private serverKeep crashing.server not being able to handle solo or co-opOutdated graphics (not having a unique style like previous games)Wonkiest AI since The Elder ScrollsGraphics glitch: removing all textures of friends in coop, of the NPCs, and of the enemiesAI is 100% broken at random times (not moving, not seeing us in front of them, etc.).NPCs are straight-up death-looking people from A Nightmare on Elm Street (hi Freddy).Gameplay being generic (but not horrible)Else...

Microsoft, Bethesda, Arkane, Sony with thir TLoU pc port, now I feel this is the trend, this is the downfall of the AAA industry, but they need to fall if we want change, that won't happen since most people have such low standards now and just keep paying for awful products, FIFA anyone?

Please just make wholesome singleplayer games, I can't believe this abomination is from the same people that made Prey and Dishonored some of the best games.

The most boring open world I’ve played an I’ve played some bad ones, doesn’t make you want to explore, it’s a chore moving across the map. Everything feels flat and uninteresting, which is insane considering how good Dishonoured and Prey still look to this day. I don’t understand how they can make a game that looks worse than previous gen titles.The performance, get some frame drops here and there and their seems to be some latency input no matter what I do, then sprinkle in all of the bugs I’ve experienced in 6 hours of playing (guns disappearing, enemies moving/freezing like they’re cardboard cutouts, sniper scope getting stuck on my screen even though I’m using other guns etc.) it’s honestly quite outstanding how bad this game is and the fact it’s been put out. To anyone finding even a slither of enjoyment in this; I salute you.

I saw a review of redfall somewhere and I 100% agree and was like: “redfall: Good enough for game pass” I saw that Phil Spencer play redfall 3 days ago and for just 37 minutes, thats says a lot of the State of Xbox. In my honest opinion they cant delay Starfield because they delayed 2 time already but i cant either launch it like redfall was. If starfield fails and i think that will be the case Phil Spencer needs to leave xbox immediately. He fail the deal with activision and he will (more like microsoft will) pay 3 billion fine and thats the same that Sony pay for bungie.",Negative

290,redfall,2-May-23,1,"RedFall ReviewRating: ★★☆☆☆RedFall, the highly anticipated game from a renowned studio, falls far short of expectations, failing to deliver an engaging and immersive experience. From its lackluster gameplay mechanics to its uninspired world design, this game left me feeling bored and unenthused.One of the biggest letdowns of RedFall is its gameplay. While the concept of battling vampires in an open-world setting sounded intriguing, the execution falls flat. The combat mechanics are repetitive and lack depth, with a limited variety of weapons and abilities that quickly become tiresome. The enemy AI is disappointingly simplistic, making encounters predictable and lacking any real challenge. It's a shame that a game centered around vampire slaying fails to create thrilling and intense gameplay moments.Moreover, the open-world design feels lifeless and uninteresting. The game world lacks meaningful exploration and fails to offer engaging side quests or activities to keep players invested. The environments lack variety and fail to captivate the imagination, resulting in a world that feels bland and forgettable.The narrative is another area where RedFall disappoints. The story fails to grip the player's attention or create a sense of urgency. The characters are poorly developed, lacking depth and relatability. The dialogue often falls into clichés and fails to evoke any emotional investment. It feels like a missed opportunity to create an immersive and compelling narrative within the vampire genre.Technical issues also plague RedFall. The game suffers from frequent glitches and performance problems, including frame rate drops and long loading times. These issues significantly hinder the overall experience and detract from any enjoyment that could have been found within the game.Furthermore, the multiplayer aspect, which was meant to be a highlight of RedFall, is underwhelming. The cooperative gameplay lacks innovation and fails to offer anything truly unique or exciting. It feels like a missed opportunity to create an engaging multiplayer experience that could have added replay value to an otherwise lackluster game .In conclusion, RedFall fails to live up to its potential, offering a dull and unremarkable gaming experience. The lackluster gameplay mechanics, uninspired world design, and underdeveloped narrative make for a forgettable game that fails to capture the imagination. Save your time and money and look elsewhere for a more engaging and enjoyable gaming experience .",Negative
291,redfall,2-May-23,0,"I have played the game for more time than I wanted and I was bored to tears on how empty and devoid of fun it is. Not even a good experience as a shoot and loot game. Not a good experience as an open world. Poor ai, poor controls, input lag, low performance, bugs, clipping, lack of interactivity, lack of story, even cutscenes, interesting characters are nowhere to be found. It’s a mess…This is an embarassment of a game. It should have never been launched in this state. Not even a AA by this point. It looks like something a small studio with big ambitions would make. Xbox continues to churn out trash and trick their consumers. The trailers we’ve seen for this game have all been substantially altered and scripted which gives out the unrealistic idea that this is a much better game then it actually is. A case where expectation vs reality is lost. I regret buying an xbox and giving microsoft a second chance (more like tenth chance). I’m not even hoping that starfield will be that good and this is proof that microsoft should stop buying studios an publishers and start getting their act together with what they have.…",Negative

294,redfall,2-May-23,10,"I had fun playing Redfall, both solo and with friends. There’s a definite Salem’s Lot vibe to a New England town oppressed by a vampire apocalypse. All the characters are interesting to play and the monsters are varied. Still, Redfall does not revolutionize the open-world shooter, or even really evolve Arkane Austin’s by-now familiar formula.

If I'd paid money for this then I'd be wanting it back, as it is Gamepass made it just a waste of my time to try. The main issues for me were that for a lootershooter the loot available quickly loses any incentive and the shooting is never exciting. The gameplay loop got stale very, very quickly. Poor combat, poor AI, no real sense of exploration, a nagging feeling that the open world has gone from trying to create jump scares into just sterile emptiness, weird design decisions on multiplayer (only host progresses, really? It's 2023), and then layer on animation glitches and other engine streaming hiccups and occasional stuttering... My goodwill evaporated rather quickly. Strengths are the little story telling moments within the world, but these are so smothered by having to design around a co-op looter shooter, and that there are moments of fun to be found with a friend in combining skills traversing and clearing areas. It's not a lot to hold up even a dozen or so hours of play. Not the worst game I've ever played but not one I'll be returning to at any point either.",Negative

This game not only didn't live up to expectations, which I think were set too high considering how bad the trailers looked, but also it's pure rubbish. Mediocre visuals, mediocre performance, mediocre story, mediocre length, mediocre variety, mediocre single player experience (when they told us it was primordially thought as a single player game, with a multiplayer mode), mediocre experience when you need to be connected to the internet all the time to play the game, etc. It's all bad news with this game! And you know what? It's 70 bucks! The only thing that's a bit fun is the multiplayer, but for just a couple of short hours.

I have run into several instances where I have clipped through textures in the environment, and I have also experienced some painful slowdown on my PC just when playing through the game. The game is terribly optimized, and the framerate is constantly chugging in just about every situation. This feels more like a choppy Xbox One game from 2014 than a complete ""AAA"" game from 2023.

Hace 30 años esto no pasaba y ya basta que estas compañías nos estén viendo como peones y beta testers para al cabo de 6 meses tener el juego como debió haber salido. Redfall es un Triple A que no aporta nada, no innova, si lo comparamos con un FPS como Crysis del 2007 o Far Cry 2, estos se comen vivo a Redfall en cuanto a mecánicas, diversión, jugabilidad y físicas. Qué un título Triple A del 2023 siga haciendo lo mismo que FPS de la década de los 128 bits es una vergüenza inaceptable. Las fallas del juego van desde su código fuente y desde su concepto y como se planteó el juego en la pre-producción. Esto no se va a arreglar con parches, porque tendrían que hacer lo mismo que hizo Square Enix con el Final Fantasy XIV, que lo tuvieron que rehacer de nuevo y relanzarlo. Aquí esa posibilidad no va a existir porque Redfall se va a convertir en el primer título deficiente de Arkane. No lo compres a menos de que esté a menos de 10 USD si únicamente te mola el concepto de los vampiros. De todas formas lo tienes en el Gamepass y lo puedes probar desde allí y vas a concordar con la mayoría de las notas de los usuarios con este título tan decepcionante.",Negative

However, I would not recommend anyone play this game at all and just simply skip it in general. The game utilizes 17GB of VRAM at 1440p with DLSS. I was shocked to see that this game was reaching the VRAM limit of my desktop 4090, I tried lowering the graphics from Ultra to High but that didn't change a single thing, and left me wondering if there is a memory leak somewhere in the game that is causing this. Because I for sure am not seeing amazing visuals for that utilization, a game like Tomb Raider 2013 or even Titanfall 2 looks a lot better than this. Gameplay is very mediocre and boring, sure the premise of the game is to run around and defeat vampires but it gets super tedious in the long run. Another thing I dislike is how most of the weapons feel and fire the same way, yes the amount of damage each gun would do is different but the feel of using them in-game is just the same across. The story is meh as well, I only played for 2-3 hrs so can't give a concise answer on that front but it doesn't seem to be interesting. Overall I would not recommend anyone pay $70 for this game, let alone not get GamePass just for this game.

The missions and side content the infiltration and mystique. Coming from someone that has been a Hardcore Arcane fan since playing Dishonored on the Xbox 360 and have been playing everything since. It is heartbreaking to see a game that feels like it should have been their first outing where they learned all of their mistakes and would build up to Dishonored and Prey. However unfortunately that is not the case. While playing you even feel that it is a freshman outing as the graphics are worse than Dishonored and it came out in 2012. I haven't quite completed it yet but with as easy as the AI is to fool that shouldn't take long as I am using the same stealth approaches I used in the previous games and I can pretty much take out all the humans and then clean up the vampires without much more than an occasional Yellow question mark.",Negative

353,redfall,2-May-23,10,"Redfall is set in a world where Morbius was baned in a country and the whole town went nuts from not being able to watch it so they turned to blood thirsty vampires seaking to drink the blood of the Morbs (morbs are morbius fans who are unable to witness pure cinema )so the goverment sent in a squad of people who watched and studied Morbius for a decade  every day to stop the Vampires from killing the Morbs. The main character mentions a theatre in the gameplay trailer saying ""i used to go here all the time"" implying that shes the regular Morb fan who always went to theatre when it was morbing time thus getting extraordinary powers from not pirating Morbius and enjoying it in cinemas everytime Now together they must destroy the morb thirsty vampires before they eradicate every Morb on planet earth making Morbius a forgotten gem it is a theory that Phil Spencer himself gave the order to delay the game and cancel the Playstation port cause Sony refused to put Morbius in the game and Spencer decided that he would include the cinema that he himself is highly dedicatedSpencer sharing my vision of the Morbius movie ive come to realise Redfall is one of if not the best games ever made and its the closest thing we can get to a Morbius game thus i give this game a clear 100/10. Which is rare since theres no Morbius in the game but bethesda clearly tries their best to make Morbius apart of the Redfall franchise this it makes it a masterpice game and a high contender for the GOTY award",Positive

371,redfall,2-May-23,3,"Ich mag Arkane eigentlich.Ihre Games sind immer auf gewisse Weise eigen, aber spaßig.Grafisch gesehen waren ihre Games nie die Oberliga, aber der Stil passte zum jeweiligen Game, hässlich waren sie nie. Aber dennoch war da immer das Gameplay, welches alles wieder ausgeglichen hat. Doch Redfall versagt auf allen Linien für mich. Grafisch ist es grottig, selbst bei maximalen Details. Stellenweise sogar schlechter als ""Dishonored 2"". Was für mich nicht schlimm wäre (Gameplay > Grafik). Aber das Gameplay ist ebenso schwach. - Das Gunplay fühlt sich nicht gut an. Gegner sind meist Bulletsponges und typische ""RPG-Like"" Abschüsse mit HP-Balken - Nicht so schlimm, wie in Fallout (hier sind Headshots zumindest bei den meisten Twinks insta-Kill), aber dennoch nervig. Den meisten Waffen fehlt die Wucht. - Die Open World ist langweilig. Zu 90% der Zeit läuft man durch leere, tote Landschaften, hin und wieder plättet man eine Gegner-Gruppe oder findet die ein oder andere kleine Notiz. Der selbe Schwachsinn wie bei ""Generation Zero"". Ja, es ist keine typische ""Kazillion-Fragezeichen-Türme-Erkletter-Ubisoft-Welt"", aber ganz leer sollte diese auch nicht sein. - Die Story kann absolut nicht mitreißen. - Die Fähigkeiten sind ganz cool, aber pro Charakter zu wenige, um wirklich coole Builds zu ermöglichen; Mir fehlt die Freiheit, wie bei Dishonored. - Laut Arkane im Solo spielbar, ist es dennoch spürbar auf Ko-op ausgerichtet. Zu oft begegnet man Gegner-Gruppen, die für einen Spieler alleine zu viel sind; viel zu viele Mechaniken behindern einen Solo-Run einfach nur, Stand jetzt fühlt sich das Game für mich wie ein stark heruntergebrochener Loot-Shooter an, wie eine BETA von einem Destiny-Klon., nein, eher sogar wie eine Alpha davon. Und besonders enttäuscht mich dabei, dass ich von Arkane besseres gewohnt bin. Wie kann es sein, dass das Game grafisch schlechter aussieht, als Deathloop, welches 2 Jahre vorher erschien? Wieso übernimmt Arkane nicht alte Stärken aus Prey, Deathloop und Dishonored und macht stattdessen so ein aus der Zeit gefallenes 08/15 Loot-Shooter-Ding draus? Bin nur froh, es nicht GEKAUFT zu haben, sondern über den Gamepass zu spielen.

The objective of the game is simple - find all the treasures hidden in the cave - but finding your way through its mazelike passages and great caverns is far from simple. Fortunately there's an automap feature that maps your progress as well as any items you've dropped, as unlike most other adventure games you can't put an infinite number of items down your pants ;) I was thrilled to play the game as it was being developed and got totally hooked exploring every nook and cranny of the cave, and even when you reach the end it feels like there's something else to discover. I would have liked to see more NPC interaction or expansion in certain areas, and players may not fully appreciate it without any knowledge of the text adventure. However as Ken and Roberta Williams have stated, this is not just a game it's like a historical document of a fundamental part of gaming history that deserves to be preserved!",Positive

It does a great job of conveying that silly, almost classic dungeon master style, but with a relaxing point and click interface. It's a game that doesn't take itself too seriously and doesn't inject anything unnecessary, it just stands on its own. You can tell that the designers loved the original enough to stay true to it. The original game had its flaws of course, but that's part of what made it a part of history. For what it's worth, I think it's very impressive for such a small indie team to release on this many platforms. Even though this game started out as a pet project, I can appreciate the effort that went into this to get it out the door.",Positive

390,colossal-cave,3-Feb-23,9,"This games is a special game created by a special breed of people. People who once led the industry in game design and pioneered technologies we now take for granted. People who came out of retirement to create a game that was as close to a perfect recreation of the game that is responsible for the entire adventure genre of gaming. People who I personally believe are the only reason this game is as good as it is.I went into this game with a full understanding of the game it comes from. I can say with all honesty, it is a faithful game interpretation that unless you have an old microcomputer laying around or understand emulation, will be the best chance of ever playing the original.It is hard, it is obtuse, it is everything the original was, but with beautiful graphics. It will make you feel alone, it will try you, it will confuse you, it may even anger you--but if you beat it, it will give you a sense of accomplishment most modern games will never give you. The graphics are beautiful for a AA game release. You will see some problems. If the tree in BOTW bugged you, the trees here may too. There are seams in some textures--which I am hopeful they will work out in future patches. The creature textures are gorgeous--a little shiny in a few but scales reflect light more than rocks--though the movement of a few creatures are a bit wonky. But, hey, if that is your only complaint, you are doing quite well.Ambient sound shines. Dialogue is very well done--especially the narrator who reads the original 70s era text to you. When I first played it I thought the gain might have been a bit too high on a few things, but I adjusted easily enough.Controls are great, with two options. One is the traditional point and click controls like you would find in classic 90s Sierra Adventures. The other is WASD and Mouse, which is more modern and more familiar to me. I played with that setup. I did not try for a controller, but if it is not there, I would hope they add it in in future patches. As for negative, I only have one real thing to say. This game is not for everyone. If you thrive on needing others in your game with you, know this is a single player game only. It is spelunking a cave. You are alone almost the whole time. Encounters are rare as most of the game is exploring and finding your way through puzzles. This is a feature as the original game was built that way. If you can not handle a game designed that way, you will not like this game. If you are okay with that kind of challenge, or you grew up on microcomputer text adventures and/or classic graphic adventures from Sierra or Lucas Arts--then this game is calling out your name. My overall advice: Buy it. Play it. Beat it. Do something only a rare segment of the world has done: conquer the Colossal Cave.",Positive

(Currently not really available)-New and enhanced graphics based of the great looking miniatures from Games Workshop.-Customizable Jersey. (Darker colors aswell as black itself are missing and will most likely be unlockable content).The neutral:-Season Pass System, bringing out new races, unlockable for free after 50-ish matches and paid after 3 months. (Currently not available)The bad:-Literally thousands of bugs. These range from performance leaks, rules not working as intended, ai taking the player hostage for 10 minutes, matches disconnecting crashing and randomly disconnecting with no way of reconnecting, memory leaks and many more-Preditory and exploitative monetization scheme which requires purchase of every cosmetic piece for every player from one team at a team at a time. Which are also heavily bugged making them easily disappear from your inventory.-Missing Content like the ability to spectate, or pause an online match aswell as admin tools for a league, no proper single player mode other the Campaign which is just 18 matches with no story or progression. No end of game Statistics or a visible rank list, Star player special rules, all unlockable content which can be unlocked through natural game progression in any mode is not available and much more. No chat, only emotes, which was probably the form of communication used for developing this game.-Working factions within the files of the game like Lizardmen, Shambling Undead, Goblins, Halflings, Underworld Denizen, Wood Elfs and Necromantic Horror sitting around with some of which being completed to 100% and a few may just not seem polishing touches but are playable other than that and are accessible with a few changes of code, similar with end of game Statistics and many other features which are just chilling in the files of the game, waiting to be sold over the span of 2 years when they are already done and accessable.-Delays summing up for 3 years total with not much progression if at all from the betas over time.-Unstable release causing players of the normal edition receiving content which was intended for the brutal edition (this problem has been addressed by giving brutal edition players additional goodies).-Stupid AI that can only defeat some certain Game Journalists or put up a fight against complete new comers to the game. This is especially apparent as somebody who spent over 100 hours playing the ai in Blood Bowl 2 or as someone who is aware of the strongest ai of them all in Blood Bowl 1. -Bad and exploitative communication with consumers on all social media sites, falsely advertising the product and directly lying to most questions, especially pre-release. Some of the moderation/community management team on the Discord being unaware either unaware of how their own game works or just willingly lying, for which I am unsure what is worse.-Non functional ranking system and matchmaking. A new player with a new team can go up against a team with up to two Million TV (that means a team that is twice as strong in team rating) that has benefits that no inducements or star players could ever balance out by the sheer amount of skills the enemy team has, where it becomes difficult for the enemy to even lose unless they are intentionally hurting their own team.-Microtransactions, mandatory part of the review of how I have to point out that this game has microtransactions, a monetization methode which is always immoral, even for free to play titles. (Which this game is not)-Online Play and Offline Play are two different accounts that do not interact with another in away way whatsoever, meaning if you play the campaign online and you wish to play offline then you will notice that your team just doesn't exist.-Poor visibility and sound design, rats will become invisible on the Nurgle pitch or similar. Constant white noise from the loud crowd that can only be reduced by lowering all effects and an ear deafening intro when launching the game which challenges the volume of the main menu theme of Counter-Strike:Global Offensive, extreme bass boosted songs on SoundCloud or most construction sites. -And in general Blood Bowl 2 being a superior product any way imaginable then this one. I mean even setting the animations settings are somehow worse then in the previous with the options being to display all, none or only armor breaks, which causes the game to ONLY display armor breaks and not something in between like in the past where it didn't show non armor breaks but showed most of everything else which was the setting everybody used and liked.

The game is nowhere close to finished, as gamebreaking bugs, constant crashes and server issues have made it impossible to play it, especially when early access was sold as a bonus. I do not joke that I could not complete 70% of the matches I attempted to play, either because the server just decided to break, the DRM decided that I was not online, or a perpetual loop started because a player used a skill that is currently bugged, ensuring that I would have to alt-f4 out of the game or just watch some repeating animation. The micro-transactions are.... obscene. On a game where the target audience are at least aware of the tabletop, everything that involves customization is paid for in real life money. Such includes things that WERE already included in bloodbowl 2, and now, you will have to buy them INDIVIDUALLY for each player. (Not a joke, each gear, paid with real money, is for one player only). I am still torn on the new aesthetics of the game, and with such a negative review, I will not comment on such because it is a matter of taste. If you do like a more gritty filter, it should please you. I prefer the bloodbowl colors flying high, but again, that part is taste. All in all, I do not reccomend this product, as it is unfinished, monetized offensively agressive and is a downgrade from its predescessor in almost all areas. I sincerely do know that this was not by accident, as there is no excuse for what they did. To both new and old players alike, this is worse then the worst fumble you had....",Negative
408,blood-bowl-iii,24-Feb-23,10,"Bon déjà pour commencer j'adore ce jeu! Je l'attendais avec impatience et enfin il est arrivé, oui même après plusieurs reports qui devenait de plus en plus inquiétant pour le développement, je ne baissait pas les bras et me dire qu'on allait bientôt pouvoir y mettre les mains dessus et c'est le cas! Bon pour commencer le jeu nous offre une grosse campagne bien garnie que malheureusement je n'ai jouer seulement peu de temps, mais qui a l'air assez complet et plutôt riche pour un jeu de ce genre et qui en plus est beaucoup, énormément, extrêmement et j'en passe des adjectifs plus poussé que blood bowl 2 mais pour le moment de ce que je constate la campagne pourrait durer presque une petite dizaine d'heures ce qui n'est pas négligeable comparé a blood bowl 2 que elle ne durait que quelques heures dans mes souvenirs. Les graphismes, j'adore les graphismes de ce jeu ils sont presque à couper le souffle oui certes c'est pas réaliste comme blood bowl 2 mais c'est plus cartoon, plus vibrant et plus coloré ce qui me donne toujours plus envie de garder l'oeil à l'écran mais je sait que il y a une partie qui préfère le côté plus réaliste de blood bowl 2 mais bon il faut au moins plaires à d'autres personnes. La customisation nous promet d'être énorme à partir de la saison 1 et les saisons futures et année futures pour l'instant la customisation est très limitée comme par exemple pour l'instant nous avons seulement droit à 1 Cheerleaders ou 3 coachs ce qui n'est pas énorme pour l'instant je vous l'accorde mais tout la customisation va grandir grâce au passe de combat qui s'appelle le malepierre qui j'imagine va coûter plus de 10$ et qui va faire grincer des dents je n'en doute même pas car si vous n'achetez pas le passe de combat vous allez rester très limitée dans votre customisation du personnage, Cheerleaders, coachs, terrains, tribune etc.... Pour ce qui est de l'IA je l'avoue elle est nul mais vraiment trop nul et je peux comprendre la déception des joueurs, Cyanide nous avait promis une IA améliorée et intelligente qui serait meilleur que blood bowl 2 mais elle est franchement ♥♥♥♥♥, elle fait de la ♥♥♥♥♥, dans une partie que c'est à en mourir de rire, à voir si ils vont l'améliorer, dans mon scénario je pense qu'ils vont essayer de l'améliorer a travers des mise à jour mais qui ne sera jamais abouti à avoir une bonne IA, et dans mon cas à moi je m'en fous un peu de l'IA car je joue seulement avec en mode campagne et de temps en temps dans le mode ligue pour m'améliorer un peu car je préfère largement jouer avec un vrai joueur mais je peux comprendre la déception des joueurs solo en ligue. Du côté de la bande sonore c'est un délice pour mes oreilles les sons sont excellents musique très bonne et bande sonore très agréable rien à redire dessus. Encore une fois je comprends la déception des joueurs car la plupart des options quasi obligatoire pour jouer comme par exemple mettre sur pause quand on joue en ligne dans le mode ligue qui va seulement arriver à la saison 2 de l'année 1 je peux comprendre le mécontentement qui devrait y être déjà disponible à la sortie du jeu. Pour conclure c'est mon préféré blood bowl largement meilleur que le 2 selon moi avec du contenu qui devrait sortir sur le jeu pour encore plusieurs et plusieurs années ce qui fait que le jeu sera encore plus supporté et mis à jour que blood bowl 2 est une bonne nouvelle selon moi et qui permet aussi à de nouveaux joueurs de pouvoir embarqué dans cet univers car oui lui au moins permets aux nouveaux joueurs de bien pouvoir apprendre et être moins perdu que les anciens blood bowl qui était moins friendly. Et oui encore une fois je comprends la grosse déception des joueurs mais je crois au moins fermement que la plupart des trucs que les gens grognent vont être réglés et oui blood bowl 2 aussi n'était pas parfait à sortie donc je crois vraiment qu'on devrait lui accorder un peu de temps et de chances car je crois vraiment qu'il a un énorme potentiel. Donc oui foncez le prendre, au prix qu'il coûte je crois pas qu'il vaut la peine d'attendre une promotion pour ceux qu'il veulent l'essayer donc je vous dis bon blood bowl et c'est l'heure du match!!!",Positive

Everything is cheap to make, nothing takes effort. The Story: Is a joke. Who is writing these games for Ubisoft? Fire them. ""Hey there, just us oppressed Settlers,, the good guys cause we said so. Now lets go to a new island, amass an army, and slaughter every living person on it. Poor us."" Just laughable. Overall: It's another identity-less, watered down, Ubisoft product. Bad design.

The campaign is a snoozefest, soldiers have like 3000 ms built in lag before responding to any command, it's full of bugs, save game stops working, multiplayer is broken and desyncs, crashes, basically the multiplayer is unplayable. The only good part of the game is Hardcore Mode, where you can play skirmish maps with modifiers which rotate weekly, with allies in co-op. Unfortunately, the game doesn't auto matchmake you with an ally for these challenges. No big deal, you can ask around in the game's discord, right? Well, no. The game doesn't have a discord. You have to browse the forums and find some unofficial fan discords. Overall, nobody seems to care about this game. Ubisoft barely promoted it, the developers are pretty much absent, it's missing basic features, and is broken in many ways. It doesn't feel like Ubisoft expects you to buy this game, it feels like they expect you to pay a month of Ubi+ subscription, try it, realize it's bad and then uninstall it. Just casual mitigation of the financial losses that they had when it became clear that the development wasn't going anywhere.

441,the-settlers-new-allies,21-Feb-23,5,"After 10 h, I am confident to say that it is a bad game. Bad in terms of not being fun to play. It is not a Settlers game, obviously, but a few points are: - It is 5/10 because I appreciate the experiment. I do not think that Ubisoft, with all its mismanagement and release fails of the past years, can handle innovation at this point.- Did you know that some Christian Hagedorn is the game's director, but apparently, the game designer behind Champions of Anteria from 2016 which originally also started as a Settlers game. We can take bets if Hagedorn's ego is mainly responsible for both game failures.- Ubisoft's desire to create a new PvP game type probably led to that LoL female announcer voice, which feels not only odd but, if you know Dota 2 or LoL, is just awkward and bad.- There is not much left of the chilling colony/settlement building game mechanics. If you need a base/colony builder, play Foundation or Farthest Frontier, to name a few.- We could go into detail regarding the horrible AI wave attacks, the surprisingly ugly UI, or how a baker is still baking without water, in terms of supply chains. But I think that these points are to be expected, if the original Settlers formula does not play a role anymore.- The campaign is awful and unimaginative. I didn't finish it, but do all scenes play in the same room, between the same 3 characters? The factions... I recall the early demo where they were different. Lore and factions do not matter at this point.- The influence of MOBAs and some competitive RTS is there, but Hagedorn, the design team, or whoever is or was in charge, clearly does not understand those genres. Settlers New Allies would probably be better off as an experimental game as its own new IP, I guess, like Champions of Anteria.- Let's hope that Hagedorn or Ubisoft do not try to create a SimCity MOBA game next. It is all about a lack of creativity and experience at game design, I guess, and how Ubisoft does not know on how to handle and check bad game designs internally. Because the art, the lighting, and I am pretty sure also the programming, if it was not been rushed, is rather solid.- It is perhaps worth mentioning that all Ubisoft Settlers games, since Settlers 5 (and we could argue about Settlers 7), have the reputation of being mediocre and a joke commercially. Ubisoft should sell this IP. Therefore, Settlers New Allies most likely mirrors the internal director and management problems that have plagued Ubisoft for years. It is beyond me why the Ubisoft management left the franchise to someone like Hagedorn who objectively failed before at the same franchise with the drama surrounding Champions of Anteria. The drama of the past months alone is worth an article. It is not only unprofessional. Ubisoft seems to be in some kind of internal crisis.",Average

After the rocky beta and a lot of player feedback I was expecting that they would put that feedback to good use and listen to the fans. But after they announced that they would not send out review copies, I got worries. If a publisher does not want outlets to test and report on their game before it launches, it's pretty clear what's going on. Being a huge fan, I still bought it and hoped for the best. Unfortunately, the game falls short in every aspect. Where older titles had complex wares that needed to be manufacturer, managed and distributed, this game has a very simplistic way of handling resources. When it comes to the Settlers games, this is the most barebone of resource management. There is barely any challenge involved with it. The features of the game are extremely lackluster and makes me wonder where all the development time went. Only 13 missions, no map generator, no map editor, the already mentioned most basic resource system and a weird combat system that does not really fit the series are some of the game's shortcomings. In addition to that, the game has severe technical issues and that might be one of the strongest reasons why they didn't want anyone to see how the ""finished"" game plays before launch. The game crashes very often and due to the terrible auto save feature I constantly lose a lot of progress. The graphics are disappointing, too. It looks like a game that might have come out a few years ago. I don't understand why they did not use a more modern engine. Although I must admit I have no problem with the graphical style itself. It's cute. All in all it's a 1/10 for me as a settlers fan. It might be fun for others, but to me it looks like a cheap use of the settlers IP for a quick cash crab. Although it is very disappointing that the game shows how little heart and care they put into their product and how little they cared about a game that is at least playable from a technical point of view.",Negative

What surprised me the most is that, in this game, both the multiplayer mode and the storyline are very weak, whereas in a real-time strategy game, it is typically the multiplayer mode that is the driving force of the gameplay.. Unfortunately, this mode is plagued with problems such as desynchronization, which causes everyone to get kicked out after just 30 minutes of gameplay. Additionally, the lack of the ability to create lobbies or custom games in multiplayer mode is frustrating.

Wanted:Dead is a not a normal game, not by a long shot. Very recently I played Valkyrie Elysium made by the same developer and both games feel very similar in terms of blandness. Valkyrie Elysium is a conservative RPG with good story and decent gameplay but it falls flat when creativity comes into play. There’s no creativity In Valkyrie Elysium, it feels tamed, most likely restricted by Square Enix. Like many other Square Enix titles these days, Valkyrie takes no chances and therefore loses its ability to wow. Wanted:Dead tries hard to be normal and very boring and stay in its lane but occasionally pulls the leash and delivers insane amounts of creatively satisfying content. The story is barely there and it’s very hard to follow and I was bored by the cutscenes until suddenly some artistic spark started coming out of the scenes at the cantina or the scene at the noodle bar. These moments make the game shine bright with charm and personality. Insane executions while wearing cat ears, face smudged in blood and then a quick smoke if you leave the controller idle. Real joy mixed with anger from the final mission that drags on forever. As a note I want to add that this game deserves way more love that it gets. Wanted:Dead is far from mediocre and this game has balls to be different in the day and age when all games are standardised and measured to feel exactly the same. 7/10",Positive

This is the first time I will openly talk about a game that left an impression on me. This is probably what bipolar disorder feels like. I have been psychologically molested by Soleil and 110 Industries and it was one of the most memorable and amazing experiences in games I had in the past 5 years. Sometimes a game comes along and you buy it because of the cover art. This is how I did it. I have never seen a pink cover art on an action game before in my life. Nobody did. This is new. I come home and I start playing. My first impression is very bad. I don’t understand any of this and the game is brutally hard. First mission, I’m still not sold on it but I keep playing because I don’t know why. Usually I just toss the game if it sucks. Wanted: Dead didn’t suck at all but I just couldn’t get it. I stopped playing a lot of games mid way because they are boring. I’m looking at you God of War Ragnarok. Wanted: Dead has a fraction of GoW’s production values but somehow it keeps you entertained. Then I spent two hours picking toys in a crane game. Yes, I’m still talking about Wanted: Dead. Then I reached August and I felt like I was going to quit but when I finally kicked his ass it was a scream of joy. My GF ran into the living room to see what’s up. Then you are treated to a karaoke sequence that is real karaoke. Do you remember Just a Friend bit from Saints Row? This is exactly it but playable. Then Space Runaway. It’s an actual 16-bit SHMUP. Not a level or something. An actual arcade game was made for Wanted: Dead and when I unlocked it, I spent hours trying to beat it. Wanted: Dead surprises you every minute. The combat really opens up on the second mission when you progress further down the skill tree. The executions are gory and fun. There’s also a chainsaw.

Creative choices, political choices and game design choices. Let’s start with game design. Wanted: Dead is hard as nails. The combat is where the game shines the most. I managed to beat the game in 14 hours and I experienced no dull moment. The mini games are absolutely amazing and worth spending time with. The claw machine is especially addictive. Political choices. Anyone with their eyes open, and I don’t mean mainstream journalism, can see the social commentary on numerous issues. One of the key characters Vivienne provides world exposition in a cooking show. Comedic, obviously, but also prophetic. She’s teaching the audience how to cook synthetic pork and describes the world where she lives in - no fresh fruit, half-sapient vegan friendly cloned beef, human flesh flavored dog cans. China rules the world in Wanted: Dead and military convicts are the police. Good or bad but Hong Kong went completely nazi, ruled by a corporation. America, obviously, lost the war, hence the reversed American flag on Herzog’s body armor. Hannah wants to quit her job and raise a boy she orphaned but is denied of doing so. There’s a lot hidden under the blanket of extreme violence, corn and wacky presentation. Am I the only one seeing all this? Creative choices. Hiring a non-English speaker to voice the protagonist is a creative choice. It’s not a fake accent. Putting a “censored” sticker over a gruesome chainsaw kill is a creative choice. A shower scene that deconstructs the entire idea of Japanese fan service is a creative choice and a bold one. The female lead literally washes away the gore from her body and you get to see the scars and bruises she got during the operation. Everything in this game is made for you to think about what every other action game out there does wrong. Wanted: Dead is the Robocop of character action games. Think about it. Last bullet point should be called pink. Wanted: Dead is like no other game out there. The minimalistic artwork with bright pink background screams style and a a degree in graphic design.

503,wanted-dead,15-Feb-23,3,"Wanted Dead es un juego horrible, horrible, horrible… La “escritura” del juego (si es que se puede llamar como tal) en el mejor de los casos era risible de lo mala que era, en el peor de los casos se sentía como si me causara daño cerebral. La historia del juego es absurda, pero ese no es el problema, el problema es que tanto las actuaciones como los temas que se discuten son de los más mundanos y secos que se pueden encontrar; es como si quien quiera que dirigiese las escenas se propusiese la tarea de tratar de hacer que los personajes parecieran mas “casuales” o “naturales” pero en cambio terminan teniendo esta serie de conversaciones que no contribuyen a nada y son completamente arbitrarias. Hay una escena de 10 minutos donde los personajes solo hablan de los ingredientes del Ramen que se están comiendo. La jugabilidad es decente, es la mejor parte del juego, afortunadamente porque, al final, esto es un videojuego. Sin embargo, la jugabilidad no es lo suficientemente buena para sostener la mayor parte del juego; consiste en tratar de mezclar una serie de elementos que no sabe muy bien como balancear, te da la opción de bloquear ataques o desviarlos, cosa que se hace al bloquearlos justo antes de que te golpeen, de vez en cuando puedes herir a los enemigos lo suficiente para crear aperturas que te permiten realizar ejecuciones -que debo decir-, son bastante variadas y quizá la mejor parte del título. Es un juego violento y sangriento, estos elementos me gustan, simplemente desearía que no fuera tan repetitivo. La variedad de enemigos se divide en dos partes, los que disparan a distancia, y los que te atacan de cerca; el juego trata de proveer un tipo de control de disparos en tercera persona pero la mayor parte de las veces es sumamente poco satisfactorio, especialmente cuando en muchas ocasiones la mira y tus disparos se ven bloqueados por el modelo del propio protagonista… La inteligencia artificial es pésima, a veces los enemigos huyen de ti, otras veces se acercan demasiado, otras veces repiten el mismo ataque una, y otra, y otra vez. El balance de dificultad es ridiculo, extremadamente fácil en muchos casos con algunos jefes siendo absurdamente difíciles en otros, el juego cuenta con un sistema donde pueden revivirte tus colegas dos veces antes de tener que reiniciar desde el ultimo punto de control, pero en ciertas situaciones -como en algunos jefes-, el juego te deja sin esta capacidad, cosa que causa que repitas el jefe desde el inicio; la mitad de las veces es difícil saber que hacer para contrarrestar estos fracasos por que el juego tiene demasiados sistemas que no se enlazan uno con el otro. A veces quiere ser un juego de disparos, otras veces quiere ser un juego de acción similar a un “Hack’n Slash”; la mitad de las veces no logra ser parte de ningún género. Además, el juego es sumamente corto, aunque no entendería bien por que alguien quisiera extender su experiencia con él. Dura alrededor de 4 horas viendo las escenas; si se jugara en dificultades relativamente fáciles estoy seguro que se podría acabar en menos que eso. Éste es un juego que desafía la pregunta; “¿Cómo pudo crearse algo como esto?” En que cabeza cupo que era una buena idea; no lo sé. El juego lo recomiendo casi como un experimento sociológico para aquellos demasiado curiosos o tercos para no ignorar un juego que no respeta ni tu inteligencia, así como tu tiempo.",Negative

521,the-last-of-us-part-i,15-Jul-23,8,"8.5/10. First of all, I played in patch 1.10, and now it seems ok, I didn't see any major bug and my performance was ok on a RX 580, not great, not bad. The Last of Us is a linear game similar to Uncharted but the difference is here we are way more focused on stealth and survival aspects. Story 8.5/10 - The game setting is an apocalyptic pandemic world where a fungus pretty much transforms people into zombies that infect people by biting them. 60% of the world's population died because of that and the rest becomes assh0l3s to survive, it is like a free for all in an abandoned world. I like how the places we get through develop this world, we have many records telling what happened with the world, the letters of ""survivors"" and the places we go really show a true post-apocalyptic world with hundreds of broken empty buildings, hundreds of cars broken down and rusted, also there are many sprayed graffiti sayings things in houses front like: ""stay away, I have a weapon and I'm gonna shot you"". Now, the main story, we follow Joel, a smuggler that lost his daughter when the pandemic apocalyptic began. He works with his partner Tess. They receive work from the Fireflights, a militia group, to smuggle a girl, Ellie, that is immune to the virus. At first, Joel tries not to be attached to the girl, he even wants to give this job up, but his partner, Tess insists, then she is bitten by an infected and begs for him to go on with the job, saying that Ellie is the only hope for this sh1tty world. Throughout the journey, they are attacked many times and meet different people. I think each of them develops something, Bill (a crazy dude that lives all alone in an abandoned district) tells Joel that is better to give up and that he is gonna die if he tries to protect other people, interestingly, Bills survives. Then we meet Henry and his younger brother Sam (that looks like his son honestly), Sam is infected and Henry suicide, IMO they show how cruel this disease is and there is no hope for those infected. We meet Joel's brother that extended his hand to give them shelter, so they have an option, but they refused, following their idealistic thoughts instead. Ellie is kidnaped by cannibals and one of them, David wanna forgave her if she abandons Joel, but she refused and fight like hell against them. I think that encounter showed the loyalty of Ellie and her furious personality. In the end, after so many hardships Joel managed to deliver the girl to the Fireflights but when arrived there, they told him she needs to die to bring the cure for mankind but Joel refuses, slaughtering everyone in his way, and rescuing the girl, the girl that in the beginning he said he didn't care. Interestingly it seems everything was for nothing and that is discussed before. But although the whole journey for both characters was for nothing, which is kinda disappointing, it showed very well how this disturbed world works. Combat 9/10 - Honestly, I am kinda saturated of with these third-person shooters but here, I must admit the system in this game is very good, maybe the best I've played. I like how in this game the human enemies don't have any radar, so if they see you but you flee they lose sight of you. Also, you can pick up a bottle of brick and throw it into the enemies to stun them or in the ground to make noise, it is a very good system. The weapon's ammunition is limited and you can craft bombs, medkits and improvements to your melee weapon. Although I liked the combat against enemies' humans, I think sometimes it is kinda repetitive and it is just there to increase the gameplay time. But for me what definitely takes the cake is the combat against the infected. They are very fun to fight against because they are so different from other type of enemies. There are many types of these infected but the most interesting aspect is that they are blind and they locate you by the sound (and some with echo-location), so if you don't make noise you can pass through them, or you can throw a brick in the ground and everyone will group up to that sound. Also, there are dark parts where the clickers make a sound so creepy, it seems like in a horror movie. Gameplay 7/10 - when we not doing all of those things above, we are resolving some puzzles and collecting resources. I thank Naughty Dog for not doing such a bad puzzle-like in Uncharted 4. Here, the puzzles are ok. Overall, 8.5/10. Great game.",Positive

I played The Last of Us on the PS3, the Remastered on PS4, and now we are at the Remake.I have to say, this is the worst Port to PC I have ever seen, the game stutters for me a lot, I am yet to see any crashes, and the shader compilation took over 2 hours?! My specs:- Ryzen 5 3600- 16GB DDR4- HDD- RTX 3060 12GI tested the game @ 1440p and 1080p with DLSS on all quality modes, on High Graphics, it runs at 60fps+ but can't maintain a constant locked Framerate, and stutters a lot, especially during combat sections. As for the price, there is no reason for this game to be full price, if you're going to buy this, DON'T. Wait 6 months, and make sure your PC is beefed up. I'd pay around $30 for a game that was already released 10 years ago with fancy graphics, and no multiplayer. The enhancements of this game are pretty poor for a ""REMAKE"", Joel may be old but give the man a dodge mechanic. I expected that to be added because damn it's pretty tough to play after being exposed to Part 2s mechanics. Yes, yes crafting table, whatever, it's just a flashy weapon upgrade screen. Clearly, Sony, Naughty Dog and Iron Galaxy did not test this game properly or at all and decided to take shortcuts. I love Playstation games, but this port hurts a lot, especially towards PC players. I want more Ports from Sony but if they are going to be like this, I don't want them, I'd rather not waste my time and not support them. It's a 6/10, Somewhat playable, but with bad stuttering at least for me, no multiplayer, and no actual or useful enhancements. A 6/10 in my book means you don't need to get this immediately, Just wait for a Sale on Steam. How the Mighty, have fallen. Personal Message to PlayStation (If an employee ever reads this): You guys make good games, I've been a fan for more than 15 years but from what I've seen recently you have forgotten that quality is better than quantity. While yes you have delivered good ports of other games so far, The Last of Us is one of your biggest properties and should have been polished from day one. One day I hope to work for PlayStation but if this is going to be the direction you'll be taking, shortcuts, following trends and making poor decisions, I would say I'm better off at EA or Ubisoft. Good luck and Happy Developing, also please Give us a Bloodborne Remake, and a Demon Souls Port, It is time.",Negative

Словам Нила Дракмана доверять нельзя, который рассказывал всем о том, что лично курирует процесс портирования и перенесли релиз именно потому, что хотели отполировать TLOU до состояния в котором игроки на ПК смогут максимально насладиться игрой.Оптимизация: 0/10Графика: При такой оптимизации 2/10Сюжет: 8/10Геймплей:  7/10Музыка: 10/10В целом плохая оптимизация не особо сильно помешала в прохождении игры, но когда покупаешь игру за 4,5 К, ждешь конечно продукт гораздо лучшего качества. Отдать данный порт такой компании как Iron Galaxy, это было просто полнейшим идиотизмом со стороны Sony, т.к. в 2015 году, эта компания портировала Batman Arkham Knight, которую потом вообще убрали из продаж почти на целый год, пока не выпустили переработанную и играбельную версию. К слову за все время существования компании Iron Galaxy, она выпустила только один более менее достойный порт не очень то популярной игры, все остальные релизы оставляли желать лучшего.  Чем нужно было руководствоваться, что бы принять решение о найме данной компании для релиза на ПК одного из флагманских эксклюзивов Sony останется загадкой.P.S. Проходил данную игру давным давно еще на PS3 и затем на PS4, так что в целом впечатления от перепрохождения её на ПК не были особо испорчены этим ужасающим релизом, но не смотря на это я не рекомендую покупать данный продукт, особенно тем, кто в него не играл ранее. Я крайне не доволен политикой Sony в отношении как ПК геймеров, так и геймеров с платформ PS. Понятное дело, что рынок и прибыль решает, но что мешает Sony прислушаться к своему комьюнити и исправить многие спорные решения, которые не требуют особых финансовых затрат как на PS, так при релизах на ПК мне скорее всего понятно, предположу что это жадность и глупость тех самых ""эффективных менеджеров"" которые принимают решения как о развитии экосистемы PS, выборе компаний для портирования своих эксклюзивов и региональных ценах, использование которых крайне странно определяется для каждой страны или региона.",Negative

Imagine Skyrim when it glitches and doesn't load the texture properly (and shows an LOD texture instead). That bad it is. And to show these textures that were bad 10 years ago, it demands 8 GB VRAM for Medium settings?

640,the-last-of-us-part-i,3-Apr-23,8,"Well, we reached that wonderful moment for all gamers, when a great game - The Last of Us (in the Russian localization - One of Us) - made its way to the PC. It took ""only"" 10 years for the game, having undergone a series of improvements and having passed the way from a game of ""format 2013"" to the version of the sample ""Part I"", reached the hands of PC-boyars on the most orthodox platform.It would seem that how can a seasoned player be surprised by a trivial plot format ""journey in a post-apocalyptic world from point A to point B""? As it turns out, it can and how. The story told in ""One of Us. Part I,"" although first told 10 years ago, is still capable of touching, surprising, giving hope and telling one of the best video game stories in 2023.The development of the relationships between the main characters is interesting to watch, the secondary characters are well-discovered and their story is interestingly presented. The visuals of the game in 2013 were pretty good even for 2023, but in the ""Part I"" version, after the introduction of modern graphics technology in general is fire.Separately, I want to draw attention to the concept of the ""green apocalypse"", when the nature begins to regain its previously lost ground on the ruins of human civilization - it's very aesthetic in itself, and the game is also very stylishly depicted.I also want to note the attention to the approach in the design of the locations - if you went into an abandoned apartment, the setting, the interior, the small details of design, etc. - Everything literally immerses you in the atmosphere of the game.Great game lore, which is conveyed through the dialogues of the characters, the environment around, notes, and the overall story - can not leave anyone indifferent.If you, like me, love a heartwarming story, well-described characters, post-apocalyptic atmosphere, and an interesting world, then I can congratulate you - this game will be a godsend. ""You can't escape or hide from the past. It will catch up with you anyway, because it's part of you...""

722,the-last-of-us-part-i,31-Mar-23,2,"Szóval március 28-án ""végre"" megjelent a The Last of Us Part 1 pc-re, amit én nagyon vártam. Ennek az oka, hogy alapból érdekelt a története és semmi érdekes vagy ténylegesen ""jó"" játék nem jelent meg mostanában. Aztán elérkezett a várva várt nap amikor megjelent a játék, én pedig másnap már játszhattam is vele. Vagyis nem egészen. Már rögtön az első indításnál a játék elkezdi Buildelni a Shadereit amiviel a fő probléma az, hogy kb 4-5 óráig csinálja (és persze ha elkezded a játékot a Shaderek nélkül kb 3 fps-ed lesz). Ez idő alatt minimum hetvenszer chraselt és **** be. Már itt látszott, hogy apc port a legnagyobb jóindulattal sem lesz okénak nevezhető, de pozitív maradtam. Cserébe viszont olyan szinten köpött pofán a Naughty Dog, hogy szóhoz sem jutok.(Amúgy nem értem a Shader dolgot. Miért kell a játékba? Ne mondja nekem senki azt, hogy ""Jobbá akarja tenni a játék az élményem ezzel a módszerrel"" mert a szintén idén megjelent Resident Evil 4 Remake minden féle shader baszakodás nélkül elfut a gépemen 60fps-el max grafikán. Nem is beszélve arról, hogy a RE4 vagy ötször szebb mint a Last of Us.)Na, de most jön a szartenger, ugyanis késöbb kiderült, hogy a Shaderes probléma még csak a jéghegy csúcsa volt; a játék úgy fut medium grafikán mintha switchen játszanám a God of War Ragnarök-ot. Többségében 15-20 fps-em van, de úgy néz ki néha szeretek Slow Motionban játszani olyan 6 fps-el. És most lehet mondani, hogy szar a gépem, de nem csak velem történik ez. Ha valaki rákeres akkor valszeg talál videót róla. Ezen kívül a játék általában 10-20 percig tölt (abba már bele sem megyek, hogyan tölt minden cutscene elött és után még 7 percig, a ""Kis türelmet..."" felirattal), és nem tudom, hogy ez az alap játék hibája-evagy egy bug, de az AI olyan KIBASZOTT buta, hogy simán szambázhatnak elötte a társaim vagy én is esetenként, mert olyan intenzitással fogják leszarni, hogy azt nem egyszer megkönnyeztem. És ezek még csak a technikai problémák, abba még bele sem kezdtem, hogy mi a problémám az alap játékkal.Először is, nem fogom végigjátszani, mivel egy csomó olyan dolgot elrontana a folyamatos frusztráltság a technikai része miatt, amiket alapból élveznék.ezért ha rendbe hozzák ezeket a gondokat, akkor adok neki még egy esélyt, ami valszeg fél év lesz minimum. Röviden a meglátásaim egyenlőre a játékról:a gunplay nem rossz, tetszik ahogy visszarúg a pisztoly, de a melee elég rossz. Egy gombot kell spamelni megállás nélkül és bár az animáció egész szép, összességében nem nagy élmény. Nagyon kevés a tényleges gameplay, sokszor csak megyünk előre percekig és semmi érdekes nem történik, ilyenkor nem játszunk ténylegesen a játékkal csak megyünk, cserébe viszont csinálhatjuk a legindokolatlanabb Quick Time Eventeket. Szóval sokszor kifejezetten unalmas. A karakterek és azok interakcióik egymással viszont zseniálisak. A Naughty Dog játékaira általában jellemző az ""Egyszerű történet, komplex karakterek"" formula, ami itt is észrevehető. Itt kiszeretném kiemelni a tökéletesen megírt és előadott párbeszédeket karakterek között.Összességében a fő problémám a játékkal az, hogy történetet mesél el és játékmenetében (főként a rengeteg QTEnek köszönhetően) elavult, ezért valószínüleg a sorozat a legjobb vélasztás a Last of Us átélésére(bár azt még nem láttam). Így játékként nekem kifejezetten unalmas.2/10 főként a borzalmas port miatt.",Negative

This broken piece of garbage is full of screen tearing and FPS drops. I don't even want to hear how this is Iron Galaxy's fault. If Naughty Dog hadn't been so cheap and lazy to do the port themselves, then there would be no reason to outsource this game to those garbage developers in the first place. I have made the decision to refund this garbage. Naughty Dog never fails to amaze me on how greedy and lazy they are. To make matters worse, this doesn't even have the multiplayer. Lazy developers only had to work on half of the game and they still couldn't get the job done. Ever since Bruce Straley left Naughty Dog, these lazy and greedy developers have not released any multiplayer, let alone a new game that's actually finished. TLOU2 doesn't count as it's still an unfinished game. It's been almost 3 years and I still haven't gotten multiplayer for TLOU2. Not even Capcom took that long to give me RE8 online, and that game came after TLOU2. That's embarrassing. At this rate, RE4 remake will have online before TLOU2. Seeing how ridiculously long Naughty Dog is taking with Factions 2, I will have high expectations for TLOU2 multiplayer. You better not disappoint me Naughty Dog.

The game pulled me in, despite the AWFUL OPTIMIZATION. Fortunately, the shader build was successful and there were no crashes. But the game has a lot of freezes, fps is not stable. A little later I noticed that my graphics card is loaded to 80-100 percent, and the processor at most 10.  For example, RDR2, Cyberpunk 2077, or that Uncharted 4 easily go with 60 fps on ultra settings without DLSS. In The Last Of US a constant drop in fps, constant freezes do not allow you to play the game normally. The game takes longer to launch on SSD than Spider-Man and Uncharted 4 together on HDD, it's impossible not to criticize. As far as I'm concerned, this is the worst port of this decade, and the worst among Sony games. One of the most important Sony exclusives came out very bad, no one expected this, but I hope that the optimization will be fixed as soon as possible, the sooner the better. I think that the bad scores that players are giving now are fully deserved, because the game is now difficult or even impossible to play because of horrible optimization. I'm sure the optimization will be fixed, and soon people will love it. It's good that a lot of people noticed this failure and didn't buy the game and spoil their opinion, and now they are waiting for patches. It's a pity of course that such a good game came out so unsuccessfully.",Negative

785,stray-blade,23-May-23,5,"Good-Decent aesthetic and colorful environments that can be fun to explore. Combat has a nice heftiness and the finishers look cool. Intriguing lore and a large map to explore. Bad-Parry and Dodge system is awkward, and limits overall expression in combat. Skills restricted to mastering different weapons, which must also be crafted. Dull protagonist, and constant pacing breaks. Numerous bugs, especially for enemies, combined with a distinct lack of polish. Enemy variety feels limited. Thoughts-Stray Blade is a game that could have been something more. With additional polish, it could at least be more fun to play, ensuring smoother exploration and less problematic enemies. However, even if some of the design choices with the combat warrant some significant overhauls, you’re still left with a fairly average story, above-average to decent exploration, and a nice-looking aesthetic.

Firstly, the visual performance was subpar on PS5 heavy stuttering all the way and unimpressive graphics that detracted from the overall gameplay experience.In addition, the design of the game felt unpolished and uninspired, with uninteresting environments and unmemorable character designs. The combat system was clunky and unsatisfying, with little variation in moves or strategies.Furthermore, the variety of enemies felt limited and repetitive, with little distinction between them beyond cosmetic differences. And finally, the story was unengaging and failed to captivate my attention, with underdeveloped characters and a lack of compelling plot points.Overall, while I can appreciate the effort that went into creating the game, I cannot recommend it due to these significant issues that hinder the gameplay experience.

793,stray-blade,21-Apr-23,8,"Stray Blade is an adventure game with souls-like elements. But that description doesnt describe the way the game is. I will go into a few of the main aspects of the game and give the good and the ugly about it. Combat:-The game has a parry, a dodge and with certain weapons a block. Perfect parries stagger an enemy for a second, deal poise damage and give back stamina. Parrying at just the wrong time blocks the damage, but doesnt stagger the enemy and leaves you open to a second attack. Just like parrying, perfect dodging recovers you some stamina but doesnt stagger enemies. And blocking is well... blocking.-The combat can feel clunky at times due to its unforgiving damage and stagger when you dont perfect dodge or parry and the stamina economy also requires you to do perfect parries and dodges. Some weapons have slow attack combos and dont have enough hyper armor, nor can you increase your poise like in a Fromsoft game. It takes some getting used to but eventually the flow of combat will become more of a dance then a battle. If you can find the patience for it that is.-The abilities you unlock troughout the game (Intium, Manninite and Xhinnon) have their own uses in combat, Intium is fun, Manninite seems fun but doesnt do enough to make it worth it and Xhinnon turns on easy-mode. Story:-The story is pretty good if you read all the extra lorestones you can find around the game and talk to Boji whenever you can. Without the lorestones and Boji the story does become confusing, and the ending becomes very confusing and a bit weird.-The valley of Acrea is very rich in its culture and history, and you can find out quite a bit about how the society was before their fall. Many areas have interesting tid bits of lore regarding them. The valley also looks very pretty. Exploration:-The exploration is this game is quite fun and reminds me of metroidvanias. You go trough an area, see some stuff you dont have the ability to get and come back later to find some nice customizations or other secrets.-The world as noted before looks great and each new area is great to look at and run around in. Performance:-I ran the game on high settings on a 3070, Intel I-7 10700k with 16GB ram. I only noticed minor performance issues in certain areas. (Have to go back and check the areas again to give acurate and recent statistics on this since my info on this is outdated) Final Thoughts:Stray Blade is a good game that I am going to be replaying a handful of times with some fun challenges for myself. There are aspects that could be better or design choices that couldve been made differently but looking at the game as a whole its 100% been a blast and I cant wait to see what the future brings to this game.",Positive

818,star-trek-resurgence,6-Jun-23,6,"PC - RTX4080. Having been a long time Trekkie I discovered this by accident while scrolling the Epic store and decided to by it on a whim as the reviews looked good. Now I don't usually either pre order or purchase games at release as I've been burned before (Arkham Knight i'm looking at you!) but I thought sod it, it can't be that bad... oh how wrong I was! Graphically this is nothing to shout about, it's done in Telltale's sudo comic book style (as the devs are ex TT staff) which I could accept as adequate if it wasnt for the god awful lack of graphical options. Who builds a game in 2023 with no native widescreen support? FML it is painful trying to get this working on a 4k monitor. But even if you can get it to play with your display it won't matter as the game will be locked to 30FPS (again in 2023!!!) for some unfathomable reason. Why? I mean it's not as if the Unreal Engine can't handle it especially as it looks like a PS3 era game. Next is the character movement and facial animations. Holy **** on a stick, for a narrative heavy point and click based game the lack of fluidity in movement and the comical facial expressions actually take you out of the moment more often than drawing you in. Following on from that **** show is the sound, or lack there of. I'm sure there are some interesting conversations to be had in this game. I couldn't tell you though as I can't hear any of them through the clipped audio and horrendous lip syncing issues. Gameplay wise, it's serviceable. You're here for the story, which is actually really good, but you keep getting interupted by random QTE which often break the immersion of a scene and are usually just filler. Oh and if you ever wanted to know if being in phaser dual is exciting... if this game is anything to go by the answer is nope. It is instead just mildly annoying. Much like the controls and oh my god the motion blur! Just give me options for graphics and controls!!! So you may think at this point that I think ST:R is a POS? Well currently, in it's bug riddled, half arsed, comically broken state, yes it is. The only thing that is saving it is the story. If they can address the major bugs with a patch then i'll give it another go just to see the story though, as it really is that good.

It's not a typical PC shoot-em-up, it follows the Telltale style of ""choose your own adventure"" story telling. It's like being a part of a Star Trek episode with your choices affecting how the episode plays out. Graphics are not groundbreaking, typical of a Telltale style game, but modern enough to be enjoyable. I found the story compelling and recommend the game, especially for Trekkers!",Positive

822,star-trek-resurgence,28-May-23,8,"As a life long trekkie growing up with TNG, DS9 & VOY I have been bitterly disillusioned by the ""nu-trek"" that we have suffered recently including the heart-breakingly bad Picard series, when I saw this was being released I was EXTREMELY sceptical. I anticipated it would be yet more cynical dystopian Trek, the antithesis of what Trek should be. Thankfully, I was wrong, I was VERY wrong. In terms of ST games this is probably one of the best from a narrative perspective, being put into the shoes of two characters, one a senior bridge officer and the other a lower decks Petty Officer working the hum drum engineering jobs of the ship. Each have their own unique perspective and effect on the story. I have to say I absolutely loved every minute of the story. It was a very well paced, intelligent story that presents the player with a wide array of choices, putting you at the heart of the ST universe. This is like the classic Trek of old where the line of right and wrong is walked, there are ethical and moral quandaries to consider and solve and (if you are so inclined) how to a Starfleet Officer should conduct themselves. That combined with very deep and well written characters it brings this game to life. I had an absolute blast with this. From a technical standpoint its not incredible, if I had to be harsh, the characters are basically from the Sims4 and the graphical performance is very mid but to be frank, thats not what this game is about. The graphics and character models are perfectly serviceable to get you through an incredibly enjoyable and story rich ""Telltale"" style game. I am sad that I have played the game and have finished it, I wish I could do it all again and enjoy it all over again. This is basically the only game in recent memory that I am absolutely desperate to see get a sequel and the Studio will have my money if that comes to pass. A must play for TNG era trekkies, this game is phenomenal as a ST game if a little rough round the edges.",Positive

Yes, there are bugs and glitches, but I’m choosing to believe the developers when they say they are working on patches and enhancements. And knowing what the industry is like; cut an indie dev some slack! Odds are they had to get something out the door by a certain time or else forfeit whatever percentage of pay they were contracted. Besides, it’s either ‘vote with your wallet’ and show Paramount/CBS that there is an appetite for Star Trek games (and with enough sales and buzz we could get a sequel!?), or don’t support the first non free2play or mobile Star Trek game in forever and end up with no more being produced for another 30 years… ",Positive

829,star-trek-resurgence,24-May-23,9,"This review for PC. While it has some graphical issues and bugs at launch (why it is 9/10), playing through the whole game was amazing. The story was gripping, the character interactions complicated, and overall, a very well-made game. I recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Star Trek, especially of the TNG/DS9/VOY era. The feel and story fit that timeline very well. It isn't a particularly challenging game, though there is some combat, it has a story mode if those combat portions prove difficult. The main appeal is making tough choices and seeing how they play out. The choices you make will bring some characters closer to the playable characters while others may distance themselves. The medium they tell the story in is very, very fitting for Star Trek. Once patches are released and the small technical issues fixed, this will be a 10/10 game. Highly recommend!",Positive
830,spongebob-squarepants-the-cosmic-shake,23-May-23,6,"""The Cosmic Shake"" should be a game full of fun. After all it's a platform-adventure game set in a world(s) with a whole spectrum of colors which can't be boring, right?... Wrong. There is nothing innovative, nothing original in its gameplay, story, or anything else, except the graphics. Yes, I admit that the graphic quality is at another level than the previous SpongeBob titles. But that means too little for a game with a level design unoriginal - I feel like playing again BFBB-Rehydrated - and unfit for a keyboard & mouse. I'm mention here only the PC version input devices where other options are missing. Game Settings and the UI are other disappointments for me. UI is not very handy to browse it, while the options for video and control settings are missing. And, personally, I found the game story pretty dull with those ideas of already overused multi / pocket universe concept.Sadly there is not much to say about the positive aspects of the game. Well, I say it once again that the graphics are of a higher quality than any of the previous games of the series. Both thumbs up for that. Also the sound design is one of the best and the background music is catchy, adding more enjoyment to the gameplay.Gameplay: 6/10Story: 4/10Characters: 7/10Video: 7/10Audio: 8/10UI: 5/10",Average

And yes, finally SpongeBob is fighting with someone normal, and not with robots (already tired of so many games). As for the disadvantages: it was disappointing that you can only control SpongeBob. Due to the reduced number of playable characters, SpongeBob becomes too strong and pumped up compared to the first part (looks a little silly) In particular, I can attribute the number of locations to the disadvantages.

I was hoping for a Movie Game Remake. But I can understand, that it was probably better to a new game. But as the 4th game in the BFBB series, it surprisingly stacks up well. But I can't help but feel that it doesn't go that much above it's peers. The problem is that like the other games in this series, people who enjoy SpongeBob are the ones who is will get the most out of this game. At it core, it's a pretty good platformer. But is nothing outstanding. Another issue is that it also doesn't really brings any improvements that BFBB sequels had. Like the upgrade system from The Movie Game. In fact it even sort of regress from BFBB. The collectables are just used for costumes. They are not tied to progression or even again the upgrade systems from The Movie Game. What's worse is that Patrick and Sandy are not playable. I know they weren't as fleshed out as SpongeBob in BFBB. But The Movie Game addressed that issue. Sandy was removed, but they made Patrick more fleshed in that game. But in defense, they did give SpongeBob more abilities to make up for that. These abilities are really fun to use. I even like they are some shortcuts you can take if you think outside the box. The levels are very fun and creative. This game clearly has a lot of effort put into it. But despite it's simplicity, I couldn't put this game down. The only real issue here is that there are some bugs and some poorly thought out moments.

852,elderand,22-Feb-23,8,"Feels like a very classic metroidvania; relatively simple and even a bit clunky, but in a good way, and so is very reminiscent of oldschool Castlevania games. Despite not reinventing the wheel in that genre, pretty much everything this game sets out to do, it does well. Great variety of weapons, magic, bows, armors, shields, items, etc. Everything feels super useful and varied aside maybe from a few consumables that are forgetable. The sense of exploration is great and intuitive, the unlockable abilities are super fun, so is the platforming, the combat is engaging (especially the fast bosses), there are tons of secrets to uncover, and the music is also quite amazing! The visuals leave a bit to be desired (some areas do stand out however!), but maybe that's only because I'm a huge fan of Blasphemous which set the bar VERY HIGH for pixel art and metroidvanias. Also it's a bit baffling that most of the text displayed is straight up in Times New Roman, making the dialogue and hints prompts feel unfinished when they're actually.. not. The story is also kinda meh. Cryptic and fine to ignore, but it does lead to great visual moments both in terms of areas to explore and boss designs. All and all, great little indie game for sure.A joy to 100% complete on my first playthrough, and will definitely play again",Positive

Also some textures look bad and pixelated. Most of the time characters theyre speaking during cutscenes there is zero body language, just stiffly standing there conversing. Is this a 2023 game title or a game made in 2008 it makes me wonder....Now the writing at times is just cringeworthy and characters mostly wishing they would be quiet.

894,aew-fight-forever,3-Jul-23,2,"Honest review from a Real Wrestling fans. To put it simply, save your money. This is no an AAA game and should not be at the AAA pricing. Like the company itself, it's no where near the top level. More glorified Indie wrestling televised and should be treated as such with video games too. At most you would want to pay $20, or $10 to be realistic. Even as a diehard AEW fan, waiting until it is discounted is the smart path. Even as a anti-wwe fan, there are other Wrestling games available aside from WWE2k23 and this, that you can put your money towards. If you are buying it for the nostalgia of the old wrestling game days, this isn't that. Better to just get a copy of No Mercy. There is little here to do. The game started out as a mobile template that was upped to a console standard. There was little care taken into the development when it comes to the animations [root motion is poorly used], modelling [obvious], effects [basic], collisions [worse than 2k20...] and of course gameplay is atrocious with little replay value. Creative suite is a joke that appears to have been a purchased 3rd party product that they then included into the game. AEW marketed this as a Arcade Wrestling game. If they marketed it as a Party game or Wrestling party game even, it could get a higher score. As the party side is more prevalent than the Wrestling side. Arcade Wrestling games still exist. Action Wrestling Arcade for instance is quite decent. To finish: If you want to support AEW by blindly buying this, would still recommend waiting until it is a better price.",Negative

897,aew-fight-forever,2-Jul-23,3,"Pretty damn bad. I don't give it a 2, because at least it works and is functional in the most basic of ways. I've now played 6.5 hours of it (no DLC purchased), but it's hard to keep going as there's not much else to do. The graphics and models are some of the worst I've seen in the last few years for a release of this supposed size—actual early PS3-level graphics. Smackdown Vs. Raw 2007 on the Xbox 360 (the first wrestling game to be in HD) looks 10x better than this. A game released 15 years ago blows AEW Fight Forever out of the water in the graphical department. The controls and gameplay when you're on the attack are decent, but kicking out and reversing are broken, and it's all up to luck. The game feels floaty to play and buggy at points. The creation suite is sad for a game in 2023. It looks promising at first, but as you look further and further into it, it's barebones in comparison to 2K, MDickie games, and Fire Pro World. Having no Community Creations is actually laughable (Yes, you CANNOT share creations online...). Not only that, but any actual CAW you make (even with formulas) looks AWFUL. The match types are a joke. I counted 6 or 7. Again, SvR 07 that's going to be 16 years old soon had waaay more match types. No full entrances either! That is probably on the level of a PS1 game... The Career/Story mode seems promising at first, but it's like they didn't have time to expand on it and after 2 hours it's just a borefest of nothing to offer. As a wrestling fan, I'm extremely disappointed. The developers and company hyped the game to be an old school wrestling game brought into a new era of gaming, but in reality it's a barebones video game that gets nothing accomplished like the old AKI games did and doesn't bring anything new to the table. It's like they forgot we're headed into 2024. Yes, you can base your gameplay and style on older games but... how about changing stuff up to reflect we're in a new age where people demand more? We're not paying 30 bucks for the game, it's a full priced AAA title, isn't it??? It's a product sold solely on the nostalgia of their fans and it's shameful the amount of DLC there is already.

The long wait and lack of content (for now) are due to the developers animating all the moves by hand, which is time-consuming compared to the motion capture of most modern sports games. It was a labor of love, and it hits the ball out of the park where it counts; the gameplay. The graphics are charming and help define the vibe of this game. Video games don't have to look like real life to be good or visually appealing—examples: WWF No Mercy, Super Mario Bros. 3, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Pong, etc. I can't wait to see what AEW Games has lined up for this title in the future, and I am hopeful there will be a stampede of content coming. I received a review copy for this review.",Positive

It is a polished, 2023 version of those games, and is an arcade game through and through. That said, it still has TONS of over the top content, such as 49 weapons, blood and gore galore,  a completely interactive and destructible environment around the ring, hidden unlockable wrestlers in the story mode, NO VIRTUAL CURRENCY YOU PURCHASE WITH REAL MONEY (hello 2K?), and extra content that will allow you to create facsimiles of NJPW wrestlers and some missing AEW talent. And the Title Belts change hands if you beat the champions in SP Exhibition, so I already have all the real, current AEW champions with their actual belts (including a Toni Storm that I had to create myself). The geeks giving this game a ZERO are either comparing it too much to WWE 2K23, which is a simulation of the TV shows, or they're just toxic WWE trolls (they're like the Snyder fans of wrestling).

The wrestling feels like homage to 'No Mercy' and I say that in the best way possible. WWE 2K's Irish Whip for instance is almost completely incoherent whereas Fight Forever's works perfectly proving that 2K's realistic graphics actually hampers the mechanics greatly. WWE 2K wins in terms of production value, but AEW wins in terms of wrestling which also happens to be a similar comparison to the real-life TV shows. AEW should start a tournament scene for the game and get a community going for it to outshine the negative reviews that only highly rate blockbuster games like God of War. Fight Forever is a FANTASTIC foundation to build on, and overall, it's more fun than slow, overly realistic 2K games.",Positive

Shooting players in pvp is seldom if ever fun, and this game is no exception. If you are on the fence about this game, give it a try - but give it a try for about 10 matches.

910,exoprimal,23-Jul-23,3,What a mess. It feels like each department was working separately on each element. There's a plot but it's told through videos in a multiplayer game so if you're in a group at slightly different levels of progression each match is followed by 1 or 2 of.ypu watching a video while everyone else is just waiting for you. Ignoring that that gameplay is mostly fine. Work together. Use giant mechs to kill lots of dinos. But it is quickly repetitive. Every mission feels the same. No idea how well the PvP aspect is balanced. Each match seems to boil down to 15 minutes of identical gameplay and then one team wiping out the other and winning the final.point. Third person camera is frustrating. The big tanks are a pain to be around as they can block your entire screen but avoiding them means not working together.,Negative
911,exoprimal,22-Jul-23,8,"The game itself is a PvEvP mission-based hero shooter. Point of the game is to work with oyur team to complete objectives for a malevolent AI and their summoned hordes of dinos. As a standalone game, you could do a lot worse as it offers a unique bit of gameplay, the 9 classes all play a bit differently from one another even though they mainly fall within the holy trinity of dps, tank, and heals, and the progression through each match varies a bit each time through. Combat and gameplay also feels pretty smooth. Characters have a little bit of personality, and the storyline, while starting a bit slow, does pick up well for the climax battle at the end. That being said, there are some issues. There is only one main game mode, Dino Survival, where you need to play over and over again to progress in the story, which can feel very repetitive. Random teams also don't know what classes others are playing until they are in the match, and matchmaking doesn't balance roles from the get go, so if one gets stuck with a poor team comp and noone changes to a needed role, the already repetitive matches can feel like a miserable slog. Some missions also force direct PvP even if PvE preference is selected, which really can feel rough for some, especially given how the nature of PvP begets the worst kinds of people. Limitations aside, what they do have feels very polished. There are minimal bugs, and servers have been quite stable from the release. The PvE race aspect of the game is quite fun, and the raid bosses, which pit all 10 players in the match against waves of enemies along with some specialty super dinos, feel challenging and have a lot of a fun factor. The price point is also a little cheaper than the current $70 trend + $30+ season pass for games as it comes at a $50 base game cost. Is it worth it at the release price? Ehhh, maybe. Really depends on if they follow through on the post-release addition promises. Definitely worth it if on sale though. Overall though, one can certainly do worse when it comes to an arcadey class-based mission shooter. Far too many are comparing it to games like Overwatch where the only similarity is that the characters are class-based (with 1-2 classes being amalgamations of multiple other classes). Honestly, the game really should be taken at it's own merits as it does find itself it's own niche, and it certainly has future potential.",Positive

Almost everry match is different and the objectives have a big variety. Combat is also really good, both in pve and pvp. Comebacks are common (as others said it's not possible in this game - that's nonsense). I wouldn't pay 60 bucks for it (i only would pay that much for AAA titles with next gen graphics and story) but it's a really good game for game pass or on sale.",Positive

But once you get to the first real boss, the Neo T-Rex, this game becomes a legitimate blast!The story is so ridiculous, that it gives me the same joy I get from watching a B action movie.

Exoprimal is, simply put, a pretty game with fun gameplay for a few hours and then it's boring. Yes, new maps and objectives unlock as you play but which one you'll get is random and the pool of options is incredibly small to start.  The variety starts to come in too late and there frankly isn't enough of it. As others have said the PvE portion of most maps feels pointless and also kind of bad, despite also being the more fun part most matches.  Doing well in the PvE gives your team a head start on the PvP section that is rendered immediately useless if one team is simply better at pvp.  The respawn times are long and there's no real comeback mechanics in play. One team wipe is often all it takes. The PVP itself is... okay.   But there seems to be no real matchmaking.  Even in the very first game I played with friends we played against a guy in an exo that needed level 40 or $15 to unlock... who also had several level 5 mods installed.  We didn't even have mods unlocked. They made a noticeable difference.3 of the exos are locked behind a rather steep grind unless you want to pay another $15 on top of the $60 price tag as well. (The game is also on gamepass, but that's still no excuse).The story isn't bad but it's told in a really sporadic and piecemeal way that feels more interrupting than anything when trying to play with friends especially if they're not on the exact same step as you. There's no real progression outside of the mods.  The exos have 100% set weapons and abilities (except their secondary rig, which are a universal pool all mechs have access to) and it gets pretty stale pretty fast. The sad truth is the game just has no content at the start, trickles in a meager amount more as you sink more and more hours into it. It has greedy microtransactions designed to get you past a very tedious grind.  The cosmetics are full on skins and can't be used piece by piece.   What kind of mech game is so rigid in its customization?The game might get better. Their road map doesn't look bad. But I'm not rating a game on what it might become. I'm rating a game on what it is.And what it is, is a repetitive, shallow experience that's probably good for a few hours on gamepass with friends and then forgotten about until it gets a leviathan sized level of updates.",Negative

It has a lot of content but the mission repeatability is annoying sometimes you get same maps other times you get the super fun ones.

If you stick with it past the first ~3-4 hours to unlock better content there is a bit more here. Great:- This is a silly, wacky, fun game that is fun with friends or complete random! These games don't exist much anymore with a decent budget.- Core gameplay and feel are GREAT! Action feels amazing. Good:- Every class feels good to play, useful to your team, and don't have any overlapping skills.- Graphics are good and have a unique artstyle.- Game is well optimized, which is a rarity for new games today.- Everything happens quickly, matchmaking and load times are FAST, you get put right into the action with -minimal downtime.- Voice acting in English is fantastic and there are a good amount of funny moments from your main crew. Okay:- The story is little wacky and at times unserious which may put some off, but it is actually decently written.- There are a lot of cosmetics, this was clearly designed as a F2P game at some point. You can buy basic skins with in-game currency (there is only ONE kind of currency) that you actually get a lot of just from playing.- Loot boxes exist, but only function for you to get cosmetics. You get a lot from just playing. Bad:- No sense of progression: the beginning of the game is lacking in content and the game doesn't let you know there are more things to do if you just keep playing. But even endgame is lacking variety- Repetitive, for the first few hours you will be doing the exact same sequence in mission on the same 2-3 maps. You need to do 15 matches (15-20 minutes a pop) before you even unlock the next thing you can do.- There is no PVE-only mode. You are ALWAYS competing against a enemy team in real time, PVE just doesn't have Exosuit vs Exosuit combat, the enemy team can still invade as a boss dinosaur.- The PVP-mode doesn't have enough Exosuit vs Exosuit, it's really just the last 2 minutes of a match.- There are about 30 minutes of tutorials and cutscenes at the beginning of the game, which SUCKED. Terrible:- This is NOT worth $60, and I can totally see it becoming free-to-play.

You can only spam the same one game mode where you do the same event (kill a lot of dinosaurs or kill one big dinosaur) over and over again then you have 2 minutes of PvP at the end.

955,destiny-2-lightfall,5-Apr-23,2,"- The story is unbelievable and childish (we encounter cybernetic humans who we see for the first time, not knowing if they even want to kill us at first sight or not, and immediately spill all our plans to them in the first sentence. and become best friends with them after a minute of talking)- The way that characters speak or joke is also pretty stupid and childish (the ghost or Nimbus in Neomuna)- The new location is pretty boring, just not exciting to play at all- The overall style of the game is inconsistent - there is a dark/gothic theme of the Hive, robotic race of the Vex, and then some characters look like in a cartoon (take a look at Shaw Han in the Cosmodrome when standing close to him)- Everything else in the game is the same as before, including the same season grind for the 20th time. Same running activities all over again just to get a nice-looking new armor and an ornament for the new exotic weapon (although we already have dozens of both armor and weapons, so another new one does not make a difference at all)- I wanted to see the group finder which was advertised for the expansion, but looks like it is only coming in the last season of the year, so together with social aspect being non-existent (zero chat going on anywhere), to assemble a group you have to actually go outside the game lol (website or mobile app)- It also looks like Bungie, the developer, does not even know what they want to do with their own game - they increased the health of enemies with the expansion, and then rolled it back after a month. So now it's back to being extremely boring where you just run through the activity killing all the enemies in one shot trying to complete daily missions (called bounties), and sometimes you shoot a rocket at them, but your teammates kill them faster than the time it takes your rocket to fly lol, so you have wasted a rocket and the ammo for it can be pretty scarce, which makes it all quite annoying So yeah, pretty bad. I wouldn't purchase or play if not for FOMO on the new armor and ornament for the exotic, so I will endure the mindless grind of the same boring activities (or give it up in the middle like already happened before)",Negative
956,destiny-2-lightfall,20-Mar-23,5,"My review will be condensed into 3 sections. Story, gameplay, and endgame.Story: Destiny 2 Lightfall story felt more like a montage of learning a new power to use against the antagonist of the story. Though there were nice messages about learning, such as "" Flow with the current, not against it."" Was the only message that stuck with me. The story was ill comparison to the last expansion Witch Queen. Destiny 2 is currently in their 20th season, and is surprisingly a 6 year old game. Long time fans of the franchise already understand that Destiny story is convoluted, and usually buried in some lore cards usually known as grimore, but personally I just search up lore in YouTube channels such as MyNameIsByf. Lightfall story isn't delivered well, and left me with more questions than answers. After a few days of reading lore I can see the direction of the story, but this isnt acceptable way of delivering a story to an audience In video game. My biggest gripe of Lightfall is how poor the 2 new characters are. Their coverage felt very brief, and didn't really care much for them. Story definitely blended with the gameplay of strand, as the story revolved around the use of strand. Gameplay: Why change something , when you already good at something? Bungie can make a great fps game. Guns look great and feel great . You can feel how fine tuned this fps is compared to other games. This is their strong suit and surprisingly they can make it work for 31 years.The new super strand has to be used and no if or buts. Story is focused around learning Strand, so that's was the main focus ironically around a super. Bungie invested so much time in making strand and tuning their gameplay. I personally think they focused around gameplay this time around.The new super feels great and fun. Though this time around I felt the campaign still maintened a challenge, and see that player scaling is much better. Though I can see that over time the gameplay can get repetitive and  eventually feel boring over time.Endgame: Funny enough I expected the endgame activities to be difficult but boy I was wrong. Raid content is supposed to be the toughest challenge in the game and be the only content to prepare for. I don't know if it's an illusion of being to experienced at the game that is 6 years old. Perhaps this is the view of long time fans of the franchise. The new raid  in my experience was very easy as there aren't many mechanics involved. I could talk about Bungies raid structure for hours. The Root of Nightmares Raid is a great raid for new players of the game. Not so much for veterans since it isn't as challenging, but I understand what Bungie was doing to get more players to do this raid. My only gripe was that every encounter except the 3rd Planets encounter was the same. Heck the last raid boss is basically first encounter with a boss. The only endgame activities I found difficult are the exotic mission in Legendary mode and Legend-higher nightfall activies. Difficulty of raids usually come from the different roles players are responsible for. Since 2 people are required to do mechanics in the new raid people can 3 man a 6 player activity. Usually Bungie has 5-6 players split in doing at most 3 roles. Perhaps this is what the community asked for based on the last non-reprisal raid Vow of The Disciple. Since there are call outs of symbols that can have different interpretations, making the raid difficult. After this expansion i believe Bungie aimed to cater to not just veterans but to newcomers, and returning players of the franchise.",Average

958,destiny-2-lightfall,16-Mar-23,6,"Pretty decent DLC, its definitely better than Beyond Light and Shadowkeep. But the narrative is strange and unclear (Rohan and Nimbus are so stereotypical) . The new raid is awesome! Its easy, fast a picturesque.",Average
959,destiny-2-lightfall,13-Mar-23,4,"Wanted to wait to review until the raid was out, so here we are. First of all, people need to stop with these dumb 0/10 ratings. Lightfall is not a 0. It's bad, but these ratings are all just spiteful, not fair. Lightfall starts off pretty good, with a nice cutscene, some intrigue and shock value, but once the actual gameplay starts, the quality drops instantly. They introduce this new civilization, but they don't flesh it out. We see 2 characters throughout the campaign, one of which is the cringiest character I think I've ever seen in Destiny and that's it. We're supposed to care about saving them and Neomuna but they don't give us a reason to. It's all just go here, stop this, kill that and it's getting tiresome. They asked 50 bucks for a campaign you can finish in 4 hours, with a barebones filler story. D2's biggest issue is its storytelling. Look at Halo 2. It was made by the same studio, yet the quality of storytelling is not even comparable. There is no character development and they conclude most things in repetitive seasonal stories. The formula they use is flawed and needs changing. As for the raid, it is visually pleasing and has OP weapons. That's about it. The mechanics are boring and overall, the raid is way too easy. I'd argue that even Vault of Glass is more difficult than this. Now, some positives are Strand. It's a fun new subclass that I can see replacing Stasis for crowd control, and it's great for movement. The Exotics and Neomuna as a location are also good. There's quite a bit to grind for and the gameplay is solid as always, but the positives don't outweigh the negatives unfortunately. This entire expansion feels like it was cut in half. I'm convinced this was all supposed to be part of The Final Shape, but they just decided to split it in two so they can milk some more money from people. Overall very disappointing and I would not recommend buying it at full price. It's barely worth 30 bucks. I suggest waiting for a sale or buying from the known third party sellers",Negative
960,destiny-2-lightfall,13-Mar-23,6,"This DLC is not as good as the Witch Queen, and I was expecting more from ""the beginning of the end"" of the light and dark saga in Destiny. The Story and narrative are a big let down, and even after all the side quests done, you're left with a huge amount of questions. But the gameplay is really good, strand is really fun and feel well balances with all of the other subclasses (not like stasis at launch). The overall content of the DLC including Raid, Events, Weapons and exotics is pretty good, even if Neomuna feels a bit empty. Get this DLC if you are a regular Destiny player, you cannot be disapointed, but if you're only interrested in the story, wait for the Final Shape, or at least for some seasons to come out.",Average

The grind isn't fun anymore, the story and writing was awful, the weapons are reskins, the raid is underwhelming, a large swath of cosmetics are locked behind the Eververse, and I'm sick of grinding out battlepasses for stuff that should have been in the game naturally. I feel like Bungie just wants me to keep dumping buckets of cash at them because of some made up of customer loyalty they think they've earned at this point and I'm sick of it. I've loved the series and the franchise since the alpha on PS4 but I don't think I can or will keep supporting this game or the Destiny series.

BUT - the Witch Queen had feeling, lore, story, interaction, meaning behind what you were doing, and intertwined what we knew and made it better.  Lightfall is just an update, not an expansion.  It feels like seasonal content wrapped into a bow and you now have to wait for a year to get conclusions...  That's not worth $100 imo.

It looks like an N64 world but with HD textures. And not to mention there are literally only two inhabitants on the entire planet that you can see. The streets and buildings are all empty (and Bungie's poor excuse to explain why its empty does not make this emptiness alright and if anything it is insulting to the player audience).

Controls are seamless, whether it's resource gathering and army generation or ordering units. Battles range from fun to tense, and there's enough to keep the gameplay feeling fresh. Bad-Some pathfinding issues for units. Unit variety and tactics may not be as in-depth as in other strategy games. Certain building methods, like ramps on your walls, aren't possible. Thoughts-While it doesn’t quite have Minecraft’s DIY toolset to build just about anything or the extensive research trees and approaches of real time strategy games, Minecraft Legends is a successful fusion of both genres into something wholly unique. It’s relatively easy to pick up and play while offering a healthy amount of depth and some fun battles that grow more challenging as you progress.

It's annoying that the Player can only help in clearing small enemies. It would be nice if the player could use an auto-guided bow (shoot at a tenacious target, for example), or other weapons with which to support the breakdown of buildings (it's not always nice to wait when your army breaks the portal, and you wait for a few minutes)The intelligence of the companions makes much to be desired, making a siege on the Horde of Disputes, I notice several times how my army just falls off the ramp, and most of the passages stand at the precipice from the stairs (especially at the Bastion)I wrote all this while going through only the Campaign, not multiplayer, not paid contentPlot: 5/10 (it's like it's made for show)Gameplay: 6/10 (plus 1 personal score)World: 7/10Mechanics: 5/10Graphics: 8/10As a result: 31/50Not bad, I would like changes",Average

1034,forspoken,29-Jul-23,3,"This is atrocious.   Absolutely atrocious.  For one, the game's actual performance is shockingly bad, we're talking about a game that looks awful even compared to stuff that's come out in the past several years, and cannot maintain a consistent framerate even with Ray-tracing off, its that bad.  I mean even Control from 2019 runs and looks better than Flop-spoken.  Secondly, the actual start of the game is seriously ten cutscenes, a 3 second run through a hallway, then another 10 seconds of running down a city street where male NPC's react to you but NPC women inexplicably don't probably because they forgot to animate it or work it into collision detection when you brushed up against certain non-interactable surfaces or something.  Then our heroine escapes into her apartment, where we get another cutscene.  I mean is this what developers think modern games are supposed to be now?  How odd, because I always heard first impressions matter. The first actual bits of gameplay in Forspoken is looking at three photos, which is not skippable for some reason, even though its just a cutscene that forces you to look at the photos- for no reason when this could be accomplished.. in a cutscene.  Actual movement in this game is bizarrely animated, and cumbersome.  I have no idea how to describe it.  Its like a skeleton on roller-skates, and Mrs. Forspoken plows into everything as if she needs to climb it or vault over it or jump off of it, because apparently this is what developers think constitutes parkour elements, when they were done better in games like Mirrors Edge over 14 YEARS AGO.  If anything this game is a strong argument that western development teams are getting less talented and more dumb every year. Beyond all of these initial unbelievably terrible choices I can't imagine playing it.  Like for more than 10 minutes, which I didn't bother to.  I wasn't about to sit through skipping cinematics to get to three minutes of gameplay that isn't interesting in the slightest.  Its not a surprise that the studio basically was shuddered after this failed to produce results, but then again SquareEnix as a publisher has been making some shockingly bad decisions as well as unwise investments in terms of development teams and this should be a wake-up call for them.  Forspoken is so awful that it shouldn't be played.  No attention should ever be given to it unless its to point out complete and utter failures in this decade so far.  Pretty wild that even the PC port with modding potentional, if anyone even cared to invest in modding potential that is, still couldn't ever hope to fix this title. As a final note, numerous channels have covered the abhorrent dialogue, writing, and just disgusting facial animations that plague what could've at least been a well presented story, even if the gameplay was mediocre.  This is that whole argument that videogame journalists like to use when it comes to garbage like Forspoken, and they would've defended it had the story been worth preserving in some way, but its hopeless trash that could barely be considered fan-fiction in terms of quality.  The dialogue is so bad, so obtuse, the narrative so bland, so lifeless, that I would rather pay a 6 year old kid to play the game, and then recall the story to me with finger puppets from memory.  At least then, I might get some entertainment out of it.  Lines like, ""you are hereby charged with the crime of Tanta-cide,"" or the fact that the main villains name is Susurrus, a word not used in the english language since 1824 and definitely not known to the writer when he was conceptualizing this turd of a game- are just the tip of iceberg when it comes to how bafflingly bad everything is. Something like Forspoken should be put in a vault, like a great evil or cursed object so our parents can tell us stories about how it almost crashed the videogame market or something 80 years from now.  It has to be seen to be believed to be quite honest, but I wouldn't recommend getting too close something this bad for your health.",Negative

But would have preferred a more linear approach as opposed to an overly large open world game. Could have used more varied enemies and a better variety of side quests that are more fleshed out. As far as the main character goes, I didn't mind her. Voice acting was good. Banter between her and Cuff was occasionally funny. It feels weird that people complain about her swearing. I was fine with that. Here's my problem. Her character arc took way too long for her to turn around. By the 50% mark she should have flipped from angry and flippant to a bit more likeable and invested in what was going on around her. This would have showed more consistent growth. Waiting until almost the end for her to 'come around' wasn't a great decision. It's okay to make a protagonist unlikable. I find it refreshing, but you have to show positive character growth throughout instead of doing a 180 at the end of the story or it comes off as unrealistic. A good example of how it should be done is in the recent series Wednesday. Started off unlikable, but by the halfway point you really enjoy the protagonist, and at the end the character growth felt satisfying. Regardless, Forspoken doesn't deserve the review bombing. It was fun. I enjoyed playing it, but felt the three main weaknesses were: repetitive quests, open world worked against the story, and character growth took far too long.",Average

Sadly, that was precisely the experience I had when I played Forspoken, a game that was supposed to be a thrilling adventure but turned out to be an exercise in political correctness and social justice. One of the biggest issues with the game was its content, which was chock-full of social justice and political correctness that had no place in the gameplay. While it's essential to have representation and inclusivity in games, it's another matter entirely when the storyline and mechanics are overshadowed by these issues. Unfortunately, that's precisely what happened with Forspoken, where the political messages felt forced, preachy, and often completely irrelevant to the gameplay. The game's storyline was also disappointing, as it seemed more interested in pushing its political agenda than providing an exciting, immersive experience. The characters were shallow and one-dimensional, with their entire existence seemingly defined by their gender, ethnicity, or sexuality. It was as if the game was trying to tick off a checklist of diversity rather than focusing on creating a compelling story with memorable characters. Even worse, the gameplay itself suffered from the game's political agenda. The mechanics were often clunky, and the controls were frustratingly difficult to master, making the game almost unplayable. It felt like the developers had focused so much on pushing their message that they forgot that the game itself needed to be enjoyable to play. Overall, Forspoeken was a massive disappointment, with its heavy-handed political messages and irrelevant social justice content detracting from what could have been a genuinely exciting gaming experience. While representation and inclusivity are essential, they should never come at the expense of gameplay or story. If you're looking for a game that delivers on both counts, I'd recommend looking elsewhere.",Negative

Es gibt verdammt viele Fähigkeiten mit einem Konzept, sie alle auseinanderhalten zu können und auch immer wieder einsetzen zu wollen. Die Grafik ist in der riesigen Open World von größeren Konstrukten (Hauptstadt ausgenommen) verloren gegangen oder noch nicht vorhanden, aber das überwiegt das schnelle und vor allem fantastische Gameplay aber mehr als genug. Man hat für alle 4 Elemente/Skill-Tree´s 3 Angriffszauber, die entweder halb-automatisch oder vollautomatisch eingesetzt werden können, die meisten davon können auch 3 Stufen lang aufgeladen werden und nochmal einen extra starken Schuss abgeben. Dann gibt es ca. 10 Unterstützungsmagien, die Target-Zauber, AOE, Heal, Buff oder Defense-Zauber sind.Jede Elementmagie hat nochmal eine Schubmagie, welche eine extrem starke Magie, die über Einsatz von Unterstützungs- und Angriffsmagie aufgeladen wird. Diese hat ebenfalls drei aufladbare Stufen und haut ordentlich rein. Die Story ist am Anfang sehr präsent, ungefähr zum Verlassen der Hauptstadt. Dann ist man erstmal auf die Open World losgelassen und ich für meinen Teil fand das völlig in Ordnung, ich wollte erstmal erkunden, alle Open World Aktivitäten kennenlernen und dann erstmal alles weiter auf dem Weg bis zum Questgebiet abarbeiten. In der Mainquest kommt man später auf Grund der vielen Zauber teilweise auch gar nicht, dafür bekommt man eine sehr schöne Story vorgesetzt. Danach hat man mehr Fähigkeiten, die man erstmal alle vollumfänglich ausprobieren möchte und dafür ist die große Open World perfekt, in die man sich dann stürzen kann, um alles auszuprobieren und auch sonst macht es einfach Spaß in riesen Gegnermenge reinzurennen und alles einzusetzen was man hat, mir hat das gesamte Spiel (mit Abstand sehr vielen anderen Spielen) sehr gefallen!",Positive

1073,forspoken,10-Feb-23,1,"I was so hyped for this game.... I approached this open-world Isekai RPG with high expectations. The promise of a high-end, graphical, realistic game made by a AAA developer, featuring a spunky, female POC protagonist, had me excited to dive into the world Square Enix had created. However, upon playing the game, it became clear that while the game featured a vast map and decent graphics, the story and gameplay fell short of many of my expectations. The world-building and rewards for exploration were underwhelming, the story was dull and cringe-worthy, the MC and dialogue was horrendous, and the traversal and combat mechanics, even if fairly fun, were clunky and jarring. Here's my breakdown: Graphics- 4/10 - The graphics in this game are a mixed bag of beauty and disappointment. While the combat, animals, enemies, foliage, hair, clothes, magic, and most environments are breathtakingly gorgeous, the water looks stale and outdated, like it belongs in an unmodded 2011 Skyrim. The models and textures for human faces are decent, but the clunky and lifeless facial animations detract from the overall experience. The skybox also feels flat and unrealistic, even when all the settings are set to Ultra, and fails to inspire any sense of awe or beauty. The landscape, while still beautiful, is marred by poor quality sky and water. The NPCs in this game are generally dull and bland looking, with the exception of Frey and a few actors that were clearly 3D scanned. Clothing designs seem to have been given more attention than NPC faces and animations. Interestingly, the children in Athia are an exception to this trend, with their faces and facial animations being of a much higher quality than the adult NPCs, which compared to other titles is surprising, out of all the NPCs in this game it seems the children, Frey, enemies, and animals are the most well done. The combat, magic, and other areas of the game are visually stunning, but ultimately fall short of a cohesive Next Gen appeal that the marketing materials implied. Worldbuilding - 9/10 - The map is pretty big, I'd wager to say it's about on par with HZD in size; there's plenty of notes and books and things to read and learn to deepen your understanding of the world and it's lore. Not much to say here, the world building felt pretty solid, the only thing that knocked a point off for me was the cringey and unrealistic commentary that starkly contrasted with the tone in the menus. Traversal - 4/10 - The game's movement mechanics are pretty fun, but alas, the parkour abilities are unfortunately hampered by invisible walls and other restrictive elements in cities. Understandably, the game disables magical traversal in certain cities, but it left me feeling cheated as I had hoped to jump and explore on rooftop using parkour throughout the game, which seemed implied by the game earlier on. Furthermore, certain areas and parts of the story force you to walk at a slow pace or prevent climbing, running, and exploring, whether due to poor collisions or simply being restricted by design, which is irksome. In summary, the traversal can be fun but is ultimately hindered by limitations in exploration and unresponsive parkour. Combat - 3/10 - The combat in the game is fairly fun to an extent, with a large skill tree to upgrade abilities, but many skills do not feel organically earned, just ""you earned enough XP and here you go, you can unlock this now"". Mixing of combat seems clunky and unintuitive, making it hard to stream combos and apply style with parkour system. The game also forces you to switch abilities on the fly with cool-down periods and slow recovery times. Dodging is fun, but seems to be introduced at the wrong point in the story, making it feel inorganic. The magic abilities are gorgeous but not well set up for chain combos, relying more on spamming and taking you out of the action with slowed menu switching. Overall, it feels like Square Enix was trying to mix Witcher 3, PS4 Spider-man, Dark Souls, and Horizon Zero Dawn combat systems, but fails to implement them in a cohesive way, leaving you with a decently fun but not overly enjoyable combat system. Story - 1/10 - The story in this game is an utter failure, with cringey dialogue, nonsensical character traits, an overly mean and un-relatable main character, missed story beats, mis-paced, and overall destruction of the suspension of disbelief. The Isekai plot points are non-existent beyond the very basic ""transported to a new world and now have superpowers"", and seems devoid of making friends or any romantic interest. The plot is predictable and shallow, as if it was written by a 6th grader. Unfunny, cringey, forgettable and boring, it put me to sleep twice so far and I am left wondering if I'll even be able to finish the game. Overall Score - 1/10 - fun to play overall, but the story and other negative points make this game very boring, un-intuitive and nauseatingly cringey.",Negative
1074,forspoken,7-Feb-23,0,"Я не представляю, как эта игра вообще смогла выйти в свет. Игра ужасна во всех смыслах, это, вероятно, худшая халтура за многие годы. Начну с того, что бросается в глаза с первого взгляда: с графики. Она не просто плохая, она действительно ужасная. Это уровень игр 2014-15 годов, но никак не 2023 года. И ладно бы при такой графике она требовала бы столько же, сколько и они. Но нет, эту убогую игру еле вытягивают карты 40-ой серии... В некоторых областях фпс падает просто катастрофически.

Сам сюжет до ужаса вторичный, а наратив просто смешон: вместо катсцен с диалогами, операторской съемкой и так далее — статичные стеклянные статуи людей, которые обмениваются звуковой информацией (речью я это назвать не могу), а игроку предлагают слушать всю эту тягомотину по несколько минут и так 15+ раз за игры. Мммм, класс (нет)Может быть весь этот ужас перевесит интересный геймплей?) Нет)) И здесь разработчики наделали в штаны: играть в это абсолютно неинтересно, карта пустая, нет никаких точек интереса, кроме ""лабиринтов"" формы прямой кишки, где в конце нас ожидают одни и те же соперники, нет адекватных сайдквестов и заданий, кроме как ""ыы пойди убей монстров где-то там/ыы а теперь убей чуть больше монстров, но вот там/ыыы вот тут на полу мана валяется, собери ее ыыы"", нет никакого желания изучать мир этой игры, он просто пустой, как и сама игра.Вердикт: провал года, пустая трата времени и денег, наглая халтура и тревожный звонок игровой индустрии.",Negative

Indeed, despite a beautiful world, I ended the game without exploring maybe 70% of the world and the reason for that lays in the lack of variety in the main quest to make us explore the world (it's mostly just go to the boss and we can do stuff on the way) and the lack of side quest. The side quest are non existent, just being useless objectives in the only city of the game. Forspoken would have been a 10/10 for me just by pushing us to explore more with real side quest and more diverse main quest.

It's one thing to take an existing IP and race swap or do something equally stupid, like trying to reform past history to conform to modern day sentiments. But the game is literally about a grubby NYC hoodrat -- and then people complain that she acts like a modern day NYC hoodrat and has crude habts, etc. This is intentional people.",Positive

Some people would say they wouldn't play this game unless they were paid to, but I say, where else can you waste $70 for a good cause? Now I know what you are thinking, the game is almost 50% cutscenes, with a boring, empty world, boring combat, diversity for the sake of wokeness, without any reasonable in world explanantion, a player character you want to push out a plane without a parachute, graphics that are both dated and unoptimized, and a story that reads like it was written by a child, without any internal continuity. All that may be true. However, keep in mind the people that made this game are all in one place, and they all failed, in every aspect. If you buy this game, they won't get fired, and if they don't get fired, they will continue being in one place making more incredibly bad games. On the other hand, if you do not buy this game, many, if not all of them, will be fired, then they will go to different companies, and many games will be worse for it. Think of this as a fee you pay to keep these people together, happily making terrible games, that you will also buy in the future to keep them together even longer. Where else can you pay $70 to contain such a destructive force? On a side note, the player character made it to my top 3 most annoying player characters ever list, right up there with the whiny idiots that you have to play as for FFX and FFXII.

The dialogue is the main highlight and seems to represent the nadir/lowest point of video games. Just even hard to imagine how the developers and the team of ""all-star"" writers could think that this game could be successful by any means. But this review is only for the developers and the writers and not the actor who voiced  Frey. Instead, I would like to commend Ella Balinska (the voice actor) for keeping up with and voicing the extremely unlikable and unsympathetic dialogue crafted by the developers and the team of ""all-star"" writers. Forspoken is a masterclass in how not to make video games. The developers should take lessons from A Plague Tale series, Red Dead Redemption series, God of War (2018 and Ragnarok), The Last of Us series, Halo series, and indie titles (Hollow Knight, Ori, Tunic, Stray, etc.) on constructing impactful video games.",Negative
1150,forspoken,27-Jan-23,9,"Really liking the game so far! Played the DEMO on PS5 so I knew what I was getting into. PROS:-Incredible loading times. Less than a second waiting after clicking „Continue“ from main menu. Appears to use DirectStorage 1.1 from .dll inspection.-Can save pretty much anywhere (no special save points or something like that).-Very fun gameplay and traversal. The combos you can do with magic are really cool. P.S. there is a way to instantly charge LV3 magic - really satisfying once you learn that.-No #StutterStruggle. If it stutters for you then I suggest check your VRAM usage. Also enabling Dynamic Resolution option causes strange stuttering for me at least. I suggest use DLSS - looks better and does not stutter.-Awesome HDR implementation. OLED TV users are in for a treat (HDR highlights really look insane on S95B OLED).-Good enough PC graphics settings (DLSS2 and FSR2 support, Ultrawide etc..)-Feels very good on K&M. Way better mouse support than FFXV (That game runs on the same engine). Menus work natively with mouse. CONS:-A lot of dialoge can appear too cringy for a lot of people it seems. I kinda like it tho. But I guess I am used to that type of dialogue in different JRPGs. Edit: after playing more the dialogue is really fine and makes sense to me. Also, Ella Balinska doing some fine VO work, good job!-GPU reqirements are really high. The demo area is not as demanding as some of the areas in the full game. I'm talking like 70-80fps in one area (the demo area to be precise) and ~55fps in another area. Both areas are tested in a non combat scenario. In combat it drops even more.-Graphics appear to be downgraded from very first 2020 trailers. Now it does look Next Gen in some scenes (Mostly in combat) while in other scenes reminds me of PS3 style lighting (Towns and some cutscenes or some non important NPC animations).-Not really that visible RT implementation (RTGI or RT Reflections would be really great additions)-Slow beggining chapters may put off some people (And a lot of janky animation work at the beggining). Tho I urge everyone to keep playing, it gets a lot better.-Quite high storage requirement. 121 GB on my SSD. Would love to give a higher rating to the game, but that lighting in most areas is pretty lame. Really strange to see a PS5/PC only game without dynamic time of day and that off putting lighting. Also I recommend playing on powerful PC, because as the time of writing 2023-01-27 the PS5 version runs really poorly. Review PC specs:CPU: i7-13700KFGPU: RTX 4080RAM: 32GB DDR5 5600MHZ CL36STORAGE: SAMSUNG 980 PRO (Heatsink version) Games runs at a mostly locked 60 FPS in 3840x2160 with maxed out settings and DLSS Balanced on this system. (DLSS Quality also works well, but has minor drops here and there). Edit: apparently in some more demangind areas I need to set DLSS to performance to prevent noticable drops. I do not think those areas are that much more striking visually to have such a pefromance cost tho. Maybe sometime a patch will make those areas run better.",Positive

Yeah, that. Fun.), the writing is interminably bad with an extremely irritating protagonist. The world building seemed encouraging enough, Athia wasn't terrible (as a world; the x-ray vision and stupid 'open world' tropes of collecting for the sake of collecting is paint-by-numbers dull), but not enough to pull anyone in because of the obvious other flaws. Because yeah, the real killer was the non-stop fade to black for cut scenes, every 10 seconds, over and over and over and over again. Unplayable. Had to refund as can't reward this game design - it's padding, nothing less than pointless padding. Also, it's unoptimised to a funny degree.

Constant fades to black and silent moments, the already slow pace of the story is further artificially slowed down ad-nauseum. The dialogue is very wooden, cliched and cringey, with awkward pauses between each line. The main character's performance is constantly over-acted and over-performed, over-expressed. Nothing here makes sense. Several dialogue/writing continuity errors. Plot hole every 10 minutes.Somewhat empty and lifeless world to explore.The main character often does things which make her unlikable, it's hard to immerse.Technically it's also badly coded/optimised, a sad reminder that modern developers and coders are using bloated, leaky untidy code. The game looks like it could've come out 8-10 years ago, but it plays like it needs a computer from the future. Overall, the game feels more like the product of board meetings and market research, with no heart or soul. The saving grace is the voice acting for Cuff, and some interesting environments, and some cool creatures/bosses.",Negative

1193,forspoken,25-Jan-23,0,"Ох. Давно я так сильно с игр не горел. ""Прошел"" форспокен, смотря стримы DeadP47. Такого лютого дерьма я давно не видел. Теперь по фактам.1. Персонажи говны.Главная героиня по всем канонам нынешней повестки нигерша, к тому же ""особенная"". Абсолютно все персонажи крайне бесят в своей тупости, лицемерии и убогости. За пример идти вообще не буду. 3 или 4 шлюхи поссорились и призвали демона. Они его победили, но не победили. Этот самый демон стал браслетами и прикрепился к каждой из этих сук, начав сводить их с ума. Как думаете, эти самые шлюхи, которые являются по совместительству правителями своих земель сделали хоть что то, чтоб уберечь своих подданных? Они их предупредили о том, что сойдут с ума? Нет! Нихуя подобного! В игре же из уст ГГ прозвучало примерно следующее ""Они являлись просто жертвами, а виноват демон"", при том, что именно они его и призвали!2. Логика говны.Тут все просто. Эти браслеты, являющиеся фактически частями демона сводили обладателей с ума. Это правило разрабы сами же и нарушили, показав гг во время сцены после титров, которая спокойно себе живёт с таким браслетом и даже с ним разговаривает. Так же логика вышла из чата потому, что у гг мать и отец белые, но при этом сама ""героиня"" является нигершой. Мать вместо того, чтоб отдать свою дочь отцу, просто выкидывает её в портал. В рандомное место и рандомное время. Попав в детский дом ещё младенцем гг получила имя. Замечу, что она могла получить абсолютно любое, хоть жопа залупина, но при этом эта сука выдает следующее ""так мать меня назвала в ее/его честь"", или что то в этом духе. И так со всем!3. Оптимизация и графика говны.Даже на 4090 ФПС порой падал до 57 кадров + фризы и другого рода говно. Эти партикли вообще бесполезны, хоть они так ими коечились. Можно было сделать куда красивее и менее ресурсозатратно. Графика хуже, чем в атсасине юнити, но это уже мем.4. Сюжет говны.Как и заведено в деловых дерьмоиграх/дерьмоаниме у нас тут гребаный исекай. Бомжиха бросила своего кота и исекайнулась в какой то фентезийный мир. Ее сразу все начали облизывать, мол какая она особенная и необычная, и так далее и так далее. По факту что мы имеем?1) Сплошные плоские клише про избранную/особенную/единственную и неповторимую.2) 12 глава просто зашквар. Все, из чего она состоит, так это из ""слезовыжималок"" и убогой экспозиции, чтоб отбелить боссов игры, мол ""они лишь жертвы, в во всем демон виноват. Такие они хорошие"" и не учитывая того, что именно эти бабы виноваты в смерти их мира.P.S. Эта игра идеально показывает то, что женщины у власти приведут цивилизацию в упадок, если не к полной аннигиляции, после чего перекинут всю вину на кого либо, лишь бы самим не отвечать за свои действия. Демон это топовый персонаж, хоть и главный злодей. Ему я импонировал куда больше, чем надменной суке.",Negative

1204,forspoken,25-Jan-23,0,"Unfortunately, Metacritic does not have a page for the PC Demo unlike for the PS5 which it does, so I will leave my review of the demo here I was excited for the game when it was announced in 2020 and was actually thinking about buying it, however as time progressed and we got to see much more gameplay footage I came to realize that the game was becoming barebones as time goes on and this was verified when I played the demo released on Steam. Starting with the performance issues it is abysmal, there is no reason for this game to suck up 10 - 12GB of VRAM during gameplay and for some reason, there are these huge random pauses for 3-4 seconds. It is way worse than your individual stutters that were prevalent in the recent releases of The Callisto Protocol. Keep in mind I am running this game on an RTX 4090 paired with a 5950X at 1440p. I locked the FPS to 60 just to see if that would mitigate it and still no hope. Clearly, the devs have skimped on optimization. This is even confirmed when the recommended GPU is an RTX 3070 which is a high mid-range GPU. Moving onto gameplay, at best it's meh. It's nothing special or actually interesting while the game does give you the ability to switch between some sort of sword and range attack magic it just feels bland and boring. This isn't supported by the fact that the world is so desolate and empty with the occasional enemy NPCs here and there, I feel like Square Enix designed the world first and just sprinkled enemies randomly toward the end when they felt like they were rushing to meet the deadline. I won't speak for the story as this was just the demo, but I will finally point out that the bracelet thing is extremely annoying. Overall don't pick this game up right now, especially given the price point is $70 (US) feels like an absolute scam. Wait for a year or so for the bugs to be ironed out and sales to kick in. I feel like the game would probably be a decent buy for $25 ish but even that's asking for a lot",Negative

Putting aside what could become the soul of this game and completely forgetting the most important; The immersion, the quality of the narration, the passion for a story, the staging, the orchestration, the atmosphere... a video game. NOT a patchwork of INVESTMENT optimization CALCULATIONS. And, ""No!"", those who tell you that 32G ram is the norm today for PC gaming are only lying to themselves. All PC sites and other gamer products offer a 16G ram configuration. So we can nitpick by saying that a real proPC will build his bike himself - yes - but that doesn't change the fact that 95% of the general public will therefore be in 16g ram and that offering an optimization for 5% of the general public for a triple A, new license with great ambitions ... it's shooting yourself in the foot. So, the truth is certainly more complicated than that and lies internally at Sqex whose ambitions and marketing have seen themselves radically turn towards NFTs... (what a good idea!)

With additional polish, it could at least be more fun to play, ensuring smoother exploration and less problematic enemies.

1241,stray-blade,21-Apr-23,8,"Stray Blade is an adventure game with souls-like elements. But that description doesnt describe the way the game is. I will go into a few of the main aspects of the game and give the good and the ugly about it. Combat:-The game has a parry, a dodge and with certain weapons a block. Perfect parries stagger an enemy for a second, deal poise damage and give back stamina. Parrying at just the wrong time blocks the damage, but doesnt stagger the enemy and leaves you open to a second attack. Just like parrying, perfect dodging recovers you some stamina but doesnt stagger enemies. And blocking is well... blocking.-The combat can feel clunky at times due to its unforgiving damage and stagger when you dont perfect dodge or parry and the stamina economy also requires you to do perfect parries and dodges. Some weapons have slow attack combos and dont have enough hyper armor, nor can you increase your poise like in a Fromsoft game. It takes some getting used to but eventually the flow of combat will become more of a dance then a battle. If you can find the patience for it that is.-The abilities you unlock troughout the game (Intium, Manninite and Xhinnon) have their own uses in combat, Intium is fun, Manninite seems fun but doesnt do enough to make it worth it and Xhinnon turns on easy-mode. Story:-The story is pretty good if you read all the extra lorestones you can find around the game and talk to Boji whenever you can. Without the lorestones and Boji the story does become confusing, and the ending becomes very confusing and a bit weird.-The valley of Acrea is very rich in its culture and history, and you can find out quite a bit about how the society was before their fall. Many areas have interesting tid bits of lore regarding them. The valley also looks very pretty. Exploration:-The exploration is this game is quite fun and reminds me of metroidvanias. You go trough an area, see some stuff you dont have the ability to get and come back later to find some nice customizations or other secrets.-The world as noted before looks great and each new area is great to look at and run around in. Performance:-I ran the game on high settings on a 3070, Intel I-7 10700k with 16GB ram. I only noticed minor performance issues in certain areas. (Have to go back and check the areas again to give acurate and recent statistics on this since my info on this is outdated) Final Thoughts:Stray Blade is a good game that I am going to be replaying a handful of times with some fun challenges for myself. There are aspects that could be better or design choices that couldve been made differently but looking at the game as a whole its 100% been a blast and I cant wait to see what the future brings to this game.",Positive

It would make a great movie or tv show (imagine that!) but the actual game parts of the game suck. The graphics are amazing and detailed, the characters and dialogue and story are intriguing, but it all keeps getting interrupted by a completely run-of-the-mill cover shooter with some stealth elements. There is only 1 part in the game I would even consider a boss fight, and it's nowhere near the end of the game. There are no puzzles, unless you count ""there's a ledge you can't reach, find the ladder conveniently placed somewhere nearby to continue"" as a puzzle, because there about a dozen of those. When the gameplay of a game is the worst part of the game, it gets a low score from me no matter how good the rest might be. After hearing for YEARS about what a masterpiece this game was, and finally being able to play it for myself (I've never owned a playstation) it did not live up to the hype at all.",Negative
1248,the-last-of-us-part-i,15-Jul-23,8,"8.5/10. First of all, I played in patch 1.10, and now it seems ok, I didn't see any major bug and my performance was ok on a RX 580, not great, not bad. The Last of Us is a linear game similar to Uncharted but the difference is here we are way more focused on stealth and survival aspects. Story 8.5/10 - The game setting is an apocalyptic pandemic world where a fungus pretty much transforms people into zombies that infect people by biting them. 60% of the world's population died because of that and the rest becomes assh0l3s to survive, it is like a free for all in an abandoned world. I like how the places we get through develop this world, we have many records telling what happened with the world, the letters of ""survivors"" and the places we go really show a true post-apocalyptic world with hundreds of broken empty buildings, hundreds of cars broken down and rusted, also there are many sprayed graffiti sayings things in houses front like: ""stay away, I have a weapon and I'm gonna shot you"". Now, the main story, we follow Joel, a smuggler that lost his daughter when the pandemic apocalyptic began. He works with his partner Tess. They receive work from the Fireflights, a militia group, to smuggle a girl, Ellie, that is immune to the virus. At first, Joel tries not to be attached to the girl, he even wants to give this job up, but his partner, Tess insists, then she is bitten by an infected and begs for him to go on with the job, saying that Ellie is the only hope for this sh1tty world. Throughout the journey, they are attacked many times and meet different people. I think each of them develops something, Bill (a crazy dude that lives all alone in an abandoned district) tells Joel that is better to give up and that he is gonna die if he tries to protect other people, interestingly, Bills survives. Then we meet Henry and his younger brother Sam (that looks like his son honestly), Sam is infected and Henry suicide, IMO they show how cruel this disease is and there is no hope for those infected. We meet Joel's brother that extended his hand to give them shelter, so they have an option, but they refused, following their idealistic thoughts instead. Ellie is kidnaped by cannibals and one of them, David wanna forgave her if she abandons Joel, but she refused and fight like hell against them. I think that encounter showed the loyalty of Ellie and her furious personality. In the end, after so many hardships Joel managed to deliver the girl to the Fireflights but when arrived there, they told him she needs to die to bring the cure for mankind but Joel refuses, slaughtering everyone in his way, and rescuing the girl, the girl that in the beginning he said he didn't care. Interestingly it seems everything was for nothing and that is discussed before. But although the whole journey for both characters was for nothing, which is kinda disappointing, it showed very well how this disturbed world works. Combat 9/10 - Honestly, I am kinda saturated of with these third-person shooters but here, I must admit the system in this game is very good, maybe the best I've played. I like how in this game the human enemies don't have any radar, so if they see you but you flee they lose sight of you. Also, you can pick up a bottle of brick and throw it into the enemies to stun them or in the ground to make noise, it is a very good system. The weapon's ammunition is limited and you can craft bombs, medkits and improvements to your melee weapon. Although I liked the combat against enemies' humans, I think sometimes it is kinda repetitive and it is just there to increase the gameplay time. But for me what definitely takes the cake is the combat against the infected. They are very fun to fight against because they are so different from other type of enemies. There are many types of these infected but the most interesting aspect is that they are blind and they locate you by the sound (and some with echo-location), so if you don't make noise you can pass through them, or you can throw a brick in the ground and everyone will group up to that sound. Also, there are dark parts where the clickers make a sound so creepy, it seems like in a horror movie. Gameplay 7/10 - when we not doing all of those things above, we are resolving some puzzles and collecting resources. I thank Naughty Dog for not doing such a bad puzzle-like in Uncharted 4. Here, the puzzles are ok. Overall, 8.5/10. Great game.",Positive

I played The Last of Us on the PS3, the Remastered on PS4, and now we are at the Remake.I have to say, this is the worst Port to PC I have ever seen, the game stutters for me a lot, I am yet to see any crashes, and the shader compilation took over 2 hours?! My specs:- Ryzen 5 3600- 16GB DDR4- HDD- RTX 3060 12GI tested the game @ 1440p and 1080p with DLSS on all quality modes, on High Graphics, it runs at 60fps+ but can't maintain a constant locked Framerate, and stutters a lot, especially during combat sections. As for the price, there is no reason for this game to be full price, if you're going to buy this, DON'T. Wait 6 months, and make sure your PC is beefed up. I'd pay around $30 for a game that was already released 10 years ago with fancy graphics, and no multiplayer. The enhancements of this game are pretty poor for a ""REMAKE"", Joel may be old but give the man a dodge mechanic. I expected that to be added because damn it's pretty tough to play after being exposed to Part 2s mechanics. Yes, yes crafting table, whatever, it's just a flashy weapon upgrade screen. Clearly, Sony, Naughty Dog and Iron Galaxy did not test this game properly or at all and decided to take shortcuts. I love Playstation games, but this port hurts a lot, especially towards PC players. I want more Ports from Sony but if they are going to be like this, I don't want them, I'd rather not waste my time and not support them. It's a 6/10, Somewhat playable, but with bad stuttering at least for me, no multiplayer, and no actual or useful enhancements. A 6/10 in my book means you don't need to get this immediately, Just wait for a Sale on Steam. How the Mighty, have fallen. Personal Message to PlayStation (If an employee ever reads this): You guys make good games, I've been a fan for more than 15 years but from what I've seen recently you have forgotten that quality is better than quantity. While yes you have delivered good ports of other games so far, The Last of Us is one of your biggest properties and should have been polished from day one. One day I hope to work for PlayStation but if this is going to be the direction you'll be taking, shortcuts, following trends and making poor decisions, I would say I'm better off at EA or Ubisoft. Good luck and Happy Developing, also please Give us a Bloodborne Remake, and a Demon Souls Port, It is time.",Negative

К слову за все время существования компании Iron Galaxy, она выпустила только один более менее достойный порт не очень то популярной игры, все остальные релизы оставляли желать лучшего.

Я крайне не доволен политикой Sony в отношении как ПК геймеров, так и геймеров с платформ PS. Понятное дело, что рынок и прибыль решает, но что мешает Sony прислушаться к своему комьюнити и исправить многие спорные решения, которые не требуют особых финансовых затрат как на PS, так при релизах на ПК мне скорее всего понятно, предположу что это жадность и глупость тех самых ""эффективных менеджеров"" которые принимают решения как о развитии экосистемы PS, выборе компаний для портирования своих эксклюзивов и региональных ценах, использование которых крайне странно определяется для каждой страны или региона.",Negative

Imagine Skyrim when it glitches and doesn't load the texture properly (and shows an LOD texture instead). That bad it is. And to show these textures that were bad 10 years ago, it demands 8 GB VRAM for Medium settings? What the hell, Naughty Dog? This port is an equivalent to running an article through google translator and publishing it without any double checks. And it gets worse... frequent crashes, massive framerate drops, loading screens that take forever. Even some immersion-shattering glitches like water not rendering correctly around objects and instead showing a large black outline... We should have known when they published the specs. 100 GB disk space for a short, linear game?Needing 16 GB VRAM to make this game look like a 3-years old PS5? Nah, the dog is more than naughty.

1367,the-last-of-us-part-i,3-Apr-23,8,"Well, we reached that wonderful moment for all gamers, when a great game - The Last of Us (in the Russian localization - One of Us) - made its way to the PC. It took ""only"" 10 years for the game, having undergone a series of improvements and having passed the way from a game of ""format 2013"" to the version of the sample ""Part I"", reached the hands of PC-boyars on the most orthodox platform.It would seem that how can a seasoned player be surprised by a trivial plot format ""journey in a post-apocalyptic world from point A to point B""? As it turns out, it can and how. The story told in ""One of Us. Part I,"" although first told 10 years ago, is still capable of touching, surprising, giving hope and telling one of the best video game stories in 2023.The development of the relationships between the main characters is interesting to watch, the secondary characters are well-discovered and their story is interestingly presented. The visuals of the game in 2013 were pretty good even for 2023, but in the ""Part I"" version, after the introduction of modern graphics technology in general is fire.Separately, I want to draw attention to the concept of the ""green apocalypse"", when the nature begins to regain its previously lost ground on the ruins of human civilization - it's very aesthetic in itself, and the game is also very stylishly depicted.I also want to note the attention to the approach in the design of the locations - if you went into an abandoned apartment, the setting, the interior, the small details of design, etc. - Everything literally immerses you in the atmosphere of the game.Great game lore, which is conveyed through the dialogues of the characters, the environment around, notes, and the overall story - can not leave anyone indifferent.If you, like me, love a heartwarming story, well-described characters, post-apocalyptic atmosphere, and an interesting world, then I can congratulate you - this game will be a godsend. ""You can't escape or hide from the past. It will catch up with you anyway, because it's part of you...""

1449,the-last-of-us-part-i,31-Mar-23,2,"Szóval március 28-án ""végre"" megjelent a The Last of Us Part 1 pc-re, amit én nagyon vártam. Ennek az oka, hogy alapból érdekelt a története és semmi érdekes vagy ténylegesen ""jó"" játék nem jelent meg mostanában. Aztán elérkezett a várva várt nap amikor megjelent a játék, én pedig másnap már játszhattam is vele. Vagyis nem egészen. Már rögtön az első indításnál a játék elkezdi Buildelni a Shadereit amiviel a fő probléma az, hogy kb 4-5 óráig csinálja (és persze ha elkezded a játékot a Shaderek nélkül kb 3 fps-ed lesz). Ez idő alatt minimum hetvenszer chraselt és **** be. Már itt látszott, hogy apc port a legnagyobb jóindulattal sem lesz okénak nevezhető, de pozitív maradtam. Cserébe viszont olyan szinten köpött pofán a Naughty Dog, hogy szóhoz sem jutok.(Amúgy nem értem a Shader dolgot. Miért kell a játékba? Ne mondja nekem senki azt, hogy ""Jobbá akarja tenni a játék az élményem ezzel a módszerrel"" mert a szintén idén megjelent Resident Evil 4 Remake minden féle shader baszakodás nélkül elfut a gépemen 60fps-el max grafikán. Nem is beszélve arról, hogy a RE4 vagy ötször szebb mint a Last of Us.)Na, de most jön a szartenger, ugyanis késöbb kiderült, hogy a Shaderes probléma még csak a jéghegy csúcsa volt; a játék úgy fut medium grafikán mintha switchen játszanám a God of War Ragnarök-ot. Többségében 15-20 fps-em van, de úgy néz ki néha szeretek Slow Motionban játszani olyan 6 fps-el. És most lehet mondani, hogy szar a gépem, de nem csak velem történik ez. Ha valaki rákeres akkor valszeg talál videót róla. Ezen kívül a játék általában 10-20 percig tölt (abba már bele sem megyek, hogyan tölt minden cutscene elött és után még 7 percig, a ""Kis türelmet..."" felirattal), és nem tudom, hogy ez az alap játék hibája-evagy egy bug, de az AI olyan KIBASZOTT buta, hogy simán szambázhatnak elötte a társaim vagy én is esetenként, mert olyan intenzitással fogják leszarni, hogy azt nem egyszer megkönnyeztem. És ezek még csak a technikai problémák, abba még bele sem kezdtem, hogy mi a problémám az alap játékkal.Először is, nem fogom végigjátszani, mivel egy csomó olyan dolgot elrontana a folyamatos frusztráltság a technikai része miatt, amiket alapból élveznék.ezért ha rendbe hozzák ezeket a gondokat, akkor adok neki még egy esélyt, ami valszeg fél év lesz minimum. Röviden a meglátásaim egyenlőre a játékról:a gunplay nem rossz, tetszik ahogy visszarúg a pisztoly, de a melee elég rossz. Egy gombot kell spamelni megállás nélkül és bár az animáció egész szép, összességében nem nagy élmény. Nagyon kevés a tényleges gameplay, sokszor csak megyünk előre percekig és semmi érdekes nem történik, ilyenkor nem játszunk ténylegesen a játékkal csak megyünk, cserébe viszont csinálhatjuk a legindokolatlanabb Quick Time Eventeket. Szóval sokszor kifejezetten unalmas. A karakterek és azok interakcióik egymással viszont zseniálisak. A Naughty Dog játékaira általában jellemző az ""Egyszerű történet, komplex karakterek"" formula, ami itt is észrevehető. Itt kiszeretném kiemelni a tökéletesen megírt és előadott párbeszédeket karakterek között.Összességében a fő problémám a játékkal az, hogy történetet mesél el és játékmenetében (főként a rengeteg QTEnek köszönhetően) elavult, ezért valószínüleg a sorozat a legjobb vélasztás a Last of Us átélésére(bár azt még nem láttam). Így játékként nekem kifejezetten unalmas.2/10 főként a borzalmas port miatt.",Negative

This broken piece of garbage is full of screen tearing and FPS drops. I don't even want to hear how this is Iron Galaxy's fault. If Naughty Dog hadn't been so cheap and lazy to do the port themselves, then there would be no reason to outsource this game to those garbage developers in the first place. I have made the decision to refund this garbage. Naughty Dog never fails to amaze me on how greedy and lazy they are. To make matters worse, this doesn't even have the multiplayer. Lazy developers only had to work on half of the game and they still couldn't get the job done. Ever since Bruce Straley left Naughty Dog, these lazy and greedy developers have not released any multiplayer, let alone a new game that's actually finished. TLOU2 doesn't count as it's still an unfinished game. It's been almost 3 years and I still haven't gotten multiplayer for TLOU2. Not even Capcom took that long to give me RE8 online, and that game came after TLOU2. That's embarrassing. At this rate, RE4 remake will have online before TLOU2. Seeing how ridiculously long Naughty Dog is taking with Factions 2, I will have high expectations for TLOU2 multiplayer. You better not disappoint me Naughty Dog.

For example, RDR2, Cyberpunk 2077, or that Uncharted 4 easily go with 60 fps on ultra settings without DLSS. In The Last Of US a constant drop in fps, constant freezes do not allow you to play the game normally. The game takes longer to launch on SSD than Spider-Man and Uncharted 4 together on HDD, it's impossible not to criticize. As far as I'm concerned, this is the worst port of this decade, and the worst among Sony games. One of the most important Sony exclusives came out very bad, no one expected this, but I hope that the optimization will be fixed as soon as possible, the sooner the better. I think that the bad scores that players are giving now are fully deserved, because the game is now difficult or even impossible to play because of horrible optimization.

1530,wanted-dead,22-Feb-23,10,"Wanted:Dead is a very fun throwback action title but it comes with fundamental design flaws like a goth kid in school trying to look normal among his peers. Wanted:Dead is a not a normal game, not by a long shot. Very recently I played Valkyrie Elysium made by the same developer and both games feel very similar in terms of blandness. Valkyrie Elysium is a conservative RPG with good story and decent gameplay but it falls flat when creativity comes into play. There’s no creativity In Valkyrie Elysium, it feels tamed, most likely restricted by Square Enix. Like many other Square Enix titles these days, Valkyrie takes no chances and therefore loses its ability to wow. Wanted:Dead tries hard to be normal and very boring and stay in its lane but occasionally pulls the leash and delivers insane amounts of creatively satisfying content. The story is barely there and it’s very hard to follow and I was bored by the cutscenes until suddenly some artistic spark started coming out of the scenes at the cantina or the scene at the noodle bar. These moments make the game shine bright with charm and personality. Insane executions while wearing cat ears, face smudged in blood and then a quick smoke if you leave the controller idle. Real joy mixed with anger from the final mission that drags on forever. As a note I want to add that this game deserves way more love that it gets. Wanted:Dead is far from mediocre and this game has balls to be different in the day and age when all games are standardised and measured to feel exactly the same. 7/10",Positive

This is the first time I will openly talk about a game that left an impression on me. This is probably what bipolar disorder feels like. I have been psychologically molested by Soleil and 110 Industries and it was one of the most memorable and amazing experiences in games I had in the past 5 years. Sometimes a game comes along and you buy it because of the cover art. This is how I did it. I have never seen a pink cover art on an action game before in my life. Nobody did. This is new. I come home and I start playing. My first impression is very bad. I don’t understand any of this and the game is brutally hard. First mission, I’m still not sold on it but I keep playing because I don’t know why. Usually I just toss the game if it sucks. Wanted: Dead didn’t suck at all but I just couldn’t get it. I stopped playing a lot of games mid way because they are boring. I’m looking at you God of War Ragnarok. Wanted: Dead has a fraction of GoW’s production values but somehow it keeps you entertained. Then I spent two hours picking toys in a crane game. Yes, I’m still talking about Wanted: Dead. Then I reached August and I felt like I was going to quit but when I finally kicked his ass it was a scream of joy. My GF ran into the living room to see what’s up. Then you are treated to a karaoke sequence that is real karaoke. Do you remember Just a Friend bit from Saints Row? This is exactly it but playable. Then Space Runaway. It’s an actual 16-bit SHMUP. Not a level or something. An actual arcade game was made for Wanted: Dead and when I unlocked it, I spent hours trying to beat it. Wanted: Dead surprises you every minute. The combat really opens up on the second mission when you progress further down the skill tree. The executions are gory and fun. There’s also a chainsaw.

Creative choices, political choices and game design choices. Let’s start with game design. Wanted: Dead is hard as nails. The combat is where the game shines the most. I managed to beat the game in 14 hours and I experienced no dull moment. The mini games are absolutely amazing and worth spending time with. The claw machine is especially addictive. Political choices. Anyone with their eyes open, and I don’t mean mainstream journalism, can see the social commentary on numerous issues. One of the key characters Vivienne provides world exposition in a cooking show. Comedic, obviously, but also prophetic. She’s teaching the audience how to cook synthetic pork and describes the world where she lives in - no fresh fruit, half-sapient vegan friendly cloned beef, human flesh flavored dog cans. China rules the world in Wanted: Dead and military convicts are the police. Good or bad but Hong Kong went completely nazi, ruled by a corporation. America, obviously, lost the war, hence the reversed American flag on Herzog’s body armor. Hannah wants to quit her job and raise a boy she orphaned but is denied of doing so. There’s a lot hidden under the blanket of extreme violence, corn and wacky presentation. Am I the only one seeing all this? Creative choices. Hiring a non-English speaker to voice the protagonist is a creative choice. It’s not a fake accent. Putting a “censored” sticker over a gruesome chainsaw kill is a creative choice. A shower scene that deconstructs the entire idea of Japanese fan service is a creative choice and a bold one. The female lead literally washes away the gore from her body and you get to see the scars and bruises she got during the operation. Everything in this game is made for you to think about what every other action game out there does wrong. Wanted: Dead is the Robocop of character action games. Think about it. Last bullet point should be called pink. Wanted: Dead is like no other game out there. The minimalistic artwork with bright pink background screams style and a a degree in graphic design. It immediately draws your attention. I purchased the collector’s edition that comes with Design Works. The attention to detail is absolutely incredible.

Hay una escena de 10 minutos donde los personajes solo hablan de los ingredientes del Ramen que se están comiendo. La jugabilidad es decente, es la mejor parte del juego, afortunadamente porque, al final, esto es un videojuego. Sin embargo, la jugabilidad no es lo suficientemente buena para sostener la mayor parte del juego; consiste en tratar de mezclar una serie de elementos que no sabe muy bien como balancear, te da la opción de bloquear ataques o desviarlos, cosa que se hace al bloquearlos justo antes de que te golpeen, de vez en cuando puedes herir a los enemigos lo suficiente para crear aperturas que te permiten realizar ejecuciones -que debo decir-, son bastante variadas y quizá la mejor parte del título. Es un juego violento y sangriento, estos elementos me gustan, simplemente desearía que no fuera tan repetitivo. La variedad de enemigos se divide en dos partes, los que disparan a distancia, y los que te atacan de cerca; el juego trata de proveer un tipo de control de disparos en tercera persona pero la mayor parte de las veces es sumamente poco satisfactorio, especialmente cuando en muchas ocasiones la mira y tus disparos se ven bloqueados por el modelo del propio protagonista… La inteligencia artificial es pésima, a veces los enemigos huyen de ti, otras veces se acercan demasiado, otras veces repiten el mismo ataque una, y otra, y otra vez. El balance de dificultad es ridiculo, extremadamente fácil en muchos casos con algunos jefes siendo absurdamente difíciles en otros, el juego cuenta con un sistema donde pueden revivirte tus colegas dos veces antes de tener que reiniciar desde el ultimo punto de control, pero en ciertas situaciones -como en algunos jefes-, el juego te deja sin esta capacidad, cosa que causa que repitas el jefe desde el inicio; la mitad de las veces es difícil saber que hacer para contrarrestar estos fracasos por que el juego tiene demasiados sistemas que no se enlazan uno con el otro. A veces quiere ser un juego de disparos, otras veces quiere ser un juego de acción similar a un “Hack’n Slash”; la mitad de las veces no logra ser parte de ningún género. Además, el juego es sumamente corto, aunque no entendería bien por que alguien quisiera extender su experiencia con él. Dura alrededor de 4 horas viendo las escenas; si se jugara en dificultades relativamente fáciles estoy seguro que se podría acabar en menos que eso. Éste es un juego que desafía la pregunta; “¿Cómo pudo crearse algo como esto?” En que cabeza cupo que era una buena idea; no lo sé. El juego lo recomiendo casi como un experimento sociológico para aquellos demasiado curiosos o tercos para no ignorar un juego que no respeta ni tu inteligencia, así como tu tiempo.",Negative

New Allies is a slightly different take, but there have been several different takes over the years.. some have worked better than others so to say it doesn't fit in with the ""Settlers"" family is disingenuous because the Settlers family is varied. I have to admit that there is work that needs to be done, but that has been the case for several iterations but the foundations they have built are beautiful and have massive potential!

Na parte multiplayer, não sabia quando ia jogar com a AI ou com um player, sei que o jogo lançou recentemente e pode haver mudanças, mas ainda sim acredito que poderia fazer algo bem melhor que o que fizeram. Sobre a mecânica do jogo, acredito que eles devem melhorar muito, pois no meio da partida, aconteceu de toda a produção parar do nada. simplesmente ninguém trabalhou mais.

Amassing an army that can conquer the map is effortless. Gathering: Get used to the same buildings and roads over, and over, and over...Nothing upgrades, nothing can be made more powerful aside from assigning an extra resource to it. Everything is cheap to make, nothing takes effort. The Story: Is a joke. Who is writing these games for Ubisoft? Fire them. ""Hey there, just us oppressed Settlers,, the good guys cause we said so. Now lets go to a new island, amass an army, and slaughter every living person on it. Poor us."" Just laughable. Overall: It's another identity-less, watered down, Ubisoft product. Bad design.

The issues with crashes that the game has are bot helping the score as well, although quite a few has already been patched.Now to the positive side - the potential of the game is huge with it’s cross platform release and crossplay enabled.

The campaign is a snoozefest, soldiers have like 3000 ms built in lag before responding to any command, it's full of bugs, save game stops working, multiplayer is broken and desyncs, crashes, basically the multiplayer is unplayable. The only good part of the game is Hardcore Mode, where you can play skirmish maps with modifiers which rotate weekly, with allies in co-op. Unfortunately, the game doesn't auto matchmake you with an ally for these challenges. No big deal, you can ask around in the game's discord, right? Well, no. The game doesn't have a discord. You have to browse the forums and find some unofficial fan discords. Overall, nobody seems to care about this game. Ubisoft barely promoted it, the developers are pretty much absent, it's missing basic features, and is broken in many ways. It doesn't feel like Ubisoft expects you to buy this game, it feels like they expect you to pay a month of Ubi+ subscription, try it, realize it's bad and then uninstall it. Just casual mitigation of the financial losses that they had when it became clear that the development wasn't going anywhere.

It is not a Settlers game, obviously, but a few points are: - It is 5/10 because I appreciate the experiment. I do not think that Ubisoft, with all its mismanagement and release fails of the past years, can handle innovation at this point.- Did you know that some Christian Hagedorn is the game's director, but apparently, the game designer behind Champions of Anteria from 2016 which originally also started as a Settlers game. We can take bets if Hagedorn's ego is mainly responsible for both game failures.- Ubisoft's desire to create a new PvP game type probably led to that LoL female announcer voice, which feels not only odd but, if you know Dota 2 or LoL, is just awkward and bad.- There is not much left of the chilling colony/settlement building game mechanics. If you need a base/colony builder, play Foundation or Farthest Frontier, to name a few.- We could go into detail regarding the horrible AI wave attacks, the surprisingly ugly UI, or how a baker is still baking without water, in terms of supply chains. But I think that these points are to be expected, if the original Settlers formula does not play a role anymore.- The campaign is awful and unimaginative. I didn't finish it, but do all scenes play in the same room, between the same 3 characters? The factions... I recall the early demo where they were different. Lore and factions do not matter at this point.- The influence of MOBAs and some competitive RTS is there, but Hagedorn, the design team, or whoever is or was in charge, clearly does not understand those genres. Settlers New Allies would probably be better off as an experimental game as its own new IP, I guess, like Champions of Anteria.- Let's hope that Hagedorn or Ubisoft do not try to create a SimCity MOBA game next. It is all about a lack of creativity and experience at game design, I guess, and how Ubisoft does not know on how to handle and check bad game designs internally. Because the art, the lighting, and I am pretty sure also the programming, if it was not been rushed, is rather solid.- It is perhaps worth mentioning that all Ubisoft Settlers games, since Settlers 5 (and we could argue about Settlers 7), have the reputation of being mediocre and a joke commercially. Ubisoft should sell this IP. Therefore, Settlers New Allies most likely mirrors the internal director and management problems that have plagued Ubisoft for years. It is beyond me why the Ubisoft management left the franchise to someone like Hagedorn who objectively failed before at the same franchise with the drama surrounding Champions of Anteria. The drama of the past months alone is worth an article. It is not only unprofessional. Ubisoft seems to be in some kind of internal crisis.",Average

After the rocky beta and a lot of player feedback I was expecting that they would put that feedback to good use and listen to the fans. But after they announced that they would not send out review copies, I got worries. If a publisher does not want outlets to test and report on their game before it launches, it's pretty clear what's going on. Being a huge fan, I still bought it and hoped for the best. Unfortunately, the game falls short in every aspect. Where older titles had complex wares that needed to be manufacturer, managed and distributed, this game has a very simplistic way of handling resources. When it comes to the Settlers games, this is the most barebone of resource management. There is barely any challenge involved with it. The features of the game are extremely lackluster and makes me wonder where all the development time went. Only 13 missions, no map generator, no map editor, the already mentioned most basic resource system and a weird combat system that does not really fit the series are some of the game's shortcomings. In addition to that, the game has severe technical issues and that might be one of the strongest reasons why they didn't want anyone to see how the ""finished"" game plays before launch. The game crashes very often and due to the terrible auto save feature I constantly lose a lot of progress. The graphics are disappointing, too. It looks like a game that might have come out a few years ago. I don't understand why they did not use a more modern engine. Although I must admit I have no problem with the graphical style itself. It's cute. All in all it's a 1/10 for me as a settlers fan. It might be fun for others, but to me it looks like a cheap use of the settlers IP for a quick cash crab.

What surprised me the most is that, in this game, both the multiplayer mode and the storyline are very weak, whereas in a real-time strategy game, it is typically the multiplayer mode that is the driving force of the gameplay.. Unfortunately, this mode is plagued with problems such as desynchronization, which causes everyone to get kicked out after just 30 minutes of gameplay. Additionally, the lack of the ability to create lobbies or custom games in multiplayer mode is frustrating. While this game does have potential, it seems that the developers' focus was more on creating a store for microtransactions and skins rather than addressing the game's issues",Negative

It looks OK visually, but everything else - everything - is a disaster. It's like the developers skim read a Wikipedia entry about the series and decided to just plow on making the most basic, uninspired RTS imaginable and slap the Settlers name on it. A question for you, Ubisoft - how can you monetise a game with in-game transactions when the game is so god-awful that nobody with half a brain could tolerate more than an hour of it? Thankfully I've got Settlers II to get the bad taste out of my mouth from this - yeah it may be around 17+ years old at this point but it has 100x the heart and gameplay of this modern trainwreck. 3/10, it should be a 2 for the graphics alone but it's also mechanically... fine I guess, it's just that it's a terrible actual game, so I give it a 3.

It's too buggy. Too many paywalls for customization. $30 isn't enough for the greedy developers. The multiplayer is complete trash. It is a broken piece of garbage. I have decided to refund this poor excuse of a game. I have played just about enough to know that this garbage isn't worth a single penny. Even at $30, this game is still too expensive.

(Currently not really available)-New and enhanced graphics based of the great looking miniatures from Games Workshop.-Customizable Jersey. (Darker colors aswell as black itself are missing and will most likely be unlockable content).The neutral:-Season Pass System, bringing out new races, unlockable for free after 50-ish matches and paid after 3 months. (Currently not available)The bad:-Literally thousands of bugs. These range from performance leaks, rules not working as intended, ai taking the player hostage for 10 minutes, matches disconnecting crashing and randomly disconnecting with no way of reconnecting, memory leaks and many more-Preditory and exploitative monetization scheme which requires purchase of every cosmetic piece for every player from one team at a team at a time. Which are also heavily bugged making them easily disappear from your inventory.-Missing Content like the ability to spectate, or pause an online match aswell as admin tools for a league, no proper single player mode other the Campaign which is just 18 matches with no story or progression. No end of game Statistics or a visible rank list, Star player special rules, all unlockable content which can be unlocked through natural game progression in any mode is not available and much more. No chat, only emotes, which was probably the form of communication used for developing this game.-Working factions within the files of the game like Lizardmen, Shambling Undead, Goblins, Halflings, Underworld Denizen, Wood Elfs and Necromantic Horror sitting around with some of which being completed to 100% and a few may just not seem polishing touches but are playable other than that and are accessible with a few changes of code, similar with end of game Statistics and many other features which are just chilling in the files of the game, waiting to be sold over the span of 2 years when they are already done and accessable.-Delays summing up for 3 years total with not much progression if at all from the betas over time.-Unstable release causing players of the normal edition receiving content which was intended for the brutal edition (this problem has been addressed by giving brutal edition players additional goodies).-Stupid AI that can only defeat some certain Game Journalists or put up a fight against complete new comers to the game. This is especially apparent as somebody who spent over 100 hours playing the ai in Blood Bowl 2 or as someone who is aware of the strongest ai of them all in Blood Bowl 1. -Bad and exploitative communication with consumers on all social media sites, falsely advertising the product and directly lying to most questions, especially pre-release. Some of the moderation/community management team on the Discord being unaware either unaware of how their own game works or just willingly lying, for which I am unsure what is worse.-Non functional ranking system and matchmaking. A new player with a new team can go up against a team with up to two Million TV (that means a team that is twice as strong in team rating) that has benefits that no inducements or star players could ever balance out by the sheer amount of skills the enemy team has, where it becomes difficult for the enemy to even lose unless they are intentionally hurting their own team.-Microtransactions, mandatory part of the review of how I have to point out that this game has microtransactions, a monetization methode which is always immoral, even for free to play titles. (Which this game is not)-Online Play and Offline Play are two different accounts that do not interact with another in away way whatsoever, meaning if you play the campaign online and you wish to play offline then you will notice that your team just doesn't exist.-Poor visibility and sound design, rats will become invisible on the Nurgle pitch or similar. Constant white noise from the loud crowd that can only be reduced by lowering all effects and an ear deafening intro when launching the game which challenges the volume of the main menu theme of Counter-Strike:Global Offensive, extreme bass boosted songs on SoundCloud or most construction sites. -And in general Blood Bowl 2 being a superior product any way imaginable then this one. I mean even setting the animations settings are somehow worse then in the previous with the options being to display all, none or only armor breaks, which causes the game to ONLY display armor breaks and not something in between like in the past where it didn't show non armor breaks but showed most of everything else which was the setting everybody used and liked.

1632,blood-bowl-iii,24-Feb-23,0,"Now, I know it does sound dramatic to give a game a 0, as it does sound like a review out of anger, but please, do try and understand the logic: This game, in the version that it is on release, has no reason to exist, as, unless you REALLY want the updates on the rules, bloodbowl 2 is an superior game, for cheaper. To say that the launch was incomplete is being kind. The game is nowhere close to finished, as gamebreaking bugs, constant crashes and server issues have made it impossible to play it, especially when early access was sold as a bonus. I do not joke that I could not complete 70% of the matches I attempted to play, either because the server just decided to break, the DRM decided that I was not online, or a perpetual loop started because a player used a skill that is currently bugged, ensuring that I would have to alt-f4 out of the game or just watch some repeating animation. The micro-transactions are.... obscene. On a game where the target audience are at least aware of the tabletop, everything that involves customization is paid for in real life money. Such includes things that WERE already included in bloodbowl 2, and now, you will have to buy them INDIVIDUALLY for each player. (Not a joke, each gear, paid with real money, is for one player only). I am still torn on the new aesthetics of the game, and with such a negative review, I will not comment on such because it is a matter of taste. If you do like a more gritty filter, it should please you. I prefer the bloodbowl colors flying high, but again, that part is taste. All in all, I do not reccomend this product, as it is unfinished, monetized offensively agressive and is a downgrade from its predescessor in almost all areas. I sincerely do know that this was not by accident, as there is no excuse for what they did. To both new and old players alike, this is worse then the worst fumble you had....",Negative
1633,blood-bowl-iii,24-Feb-23,10,"Bon déjà pour commencer j'adore ce jeu! Je l'attendais avec impatience et enfin il est arrivé, oui même après plusieurs reports qui devenait de plus en plus inquiétant pour le développement, je ne baissait pas les bras et me dire qu'on allait bientôt pouvoir y mettre les mains dessus et c'est le cas! Bon pour commencer le jeu nous offre une grosse campagne bien garnie que malheureusement je n'ai jouer seulement peu de temps, mais qui a l'air assez complet et plutôt riche pour un jeu de ce genre et qui en plus est beaucoup, énormément, extrêmement et j'en passe des adjectifs plus poussé que blood bowl 2 mais pour le moment de ce que je constate la campagne pourrait durer presque une petite dizaine d'heures ce qui n'est pas négligeable comparé a blood bowl 2 que elle ne durait que quelques heures dans mes souvenirs. Les graphismes, j'adore les graphismes de ce jeu ils sont presque à couper le souffle oui certes c'est pas réaliste comme blood bowl 2 mais c'est plus cartoon, plus vibrant et plus coloré ce qui me donne toujours plus envie de garder l'oeil à l'écran mais je sait que il y a une partie qui préfère le côté plus réaliste de blood bowl 2 mais bon il faut au moins plaires à d'autres personnes. La customisation nous promet d'être énorme à partir de la saison 1 et les saisons futures et année futures pour l'instant la customisation est très limitée comme par exemple pour l'instant nous avons seulement droit à 1 Cheerleaders ou 3 coachs ce qui n'est pas énorme pour l'instant je vous l'accorde mais tout la customisation va grandir grâce au passe de combat qui s'appelle le malepierre qui j'imagine va coûter plus de 10$ et qui va faire grincer des dents je n'en doute même pas car si vous n'achetez pas le passe de combat vous allez rester très limitée dans votre customisation du personnage, Cheerleaders, coachs, terrains, tribune etc.... Pour ce qui est de l'IA je l'avoue elle est nul mais vraiment trop nul et je peux comprendre la déception des joueurs, Cyanide nous avait promis une IA améliorée et intelligente qui serait meilleur que blood bowl 2 mais elle est franchement ♥♥♥♥♥, elle fait de la ♥♥♥♥♥, dans une partie que c'est à en mourir de rire, à voir si ils vont l'améliorer, dans mon scénario je pense qu'ils vont essayer de l'améliorer a travers des mise à jour mais qui ne sera jamais abouti à avoir une bonne IA, et dans mon cas à moi je m'en fous un peu de l'IA car je joue seulement avec en mode campagne et de temps en temps dans le mode ligue pour m'améliorer un peu car je préfère largement jouer avec un vrai joueur mais je peux comprendre la déception des joueurs solo en ligue. Du côté de la bande sonore c'est un délice pour mes oreilles les sons sont excellents musique très bonne et bande sonore très agréable rien à redire dessus. Encore une fois je comprends la déception des joueurs car la plupart des options quasi obligatoire pour jouer comme par exemple mettre sur pause quand on joue en ligne dans le mode ligue qui va seulement arriver à la saison 2 de l'année 1 je peux comprendre le mécontentement qui devrait y être déjà disponible à la sortie du jeu. Pour conclure c'est mon préféré blood bowl largement meilleur que le 2 selon moi avec du contenu qui devrait sortir sur le jeu pour encore plusieurs et plusieurs années ce qui fait que le jeu sera encore plus supporté et mis à jour que blood bowl 2 est une bonne nouvelle selon moi et qui permet aussi à de nouveaux joueurs de pouvoir embarqué dans cet univers car oui lui au moins permets aux nouveaux joueurs de bien pouvoir apprendre et être moins perdu que les anciens blood bowl qui était moins friendly. Et oui encore une fois je comprends la grosse déception des joueurs mais je crois au moins fermement que la plupart des trucs que les gens grognent vont être réglés et oui blood bowl 2 aussi n'était pas parfait à sortie donc je crois vraiment qu'on devrait lui accorder un peu de temps et de chances car je crois vraiment qu'il a un énorme potentiel. Donc oui foncez le prendre, au prix qu'il coûte je crois pas qu'il vaut la peine d'attendre une promotion pour ceux qu'il veulent l'essayer donc je vous dis bon blood bowl et c'est l'heure du match!!!",Positive

The objective of the game is simple - find all the treasures hidden in the cave - but finding your way through its mazelike passages and great caverns is far from simple. Fortunately there's an automap feature that maps your progress as well as any items you've dropped, as unlike most other adventure games you can't put an infinite number of items down your pants ;) I was thrilled to play the game as it was being developed and got totally hooked exploring every nook and cranny of the cave, and even when you reach the end it feels like there's something else to discover. I would have liked to see more NPC interaction or expansion in certain areas, and players may not fully appreciate it without any knowledge of the text adventure.

It does a great job of conveying that silly, almost classic dungeon master style, but with a relaxing point and click interface. It's a game that doesn't take itself too seriously and doesn't inject anything unnecessary, it just stands on its own. You can tell that the designers loved the original enough to stay true to it. The original game had its flaws of course, but that's part of what made it a part of history. For what it's worth, I think it's very impressive for such a small indie team to release on this many platforms.

1646,colossal-cave,3-Feb-23,9,"This games is a special game created by a special breed of people. People who once led the industry in game design and pioneered technologies we now take for granted. People who came out of retirement to create a game that was as close to a perfect recreation of the game that is responsible for the entire adventure genre of gaming. People who I personally believe are the only reason this game is as good as it is.I went into this game with a full understanding of the game it comes from. I can say with all honesty, it is a faithful game interpretation that unless you have an old microcomputer laying around or understand emulation, will be the best chance of ever playing the original.It is hard, it is obtuse, it is everything the original was, but with beautiful graphics. It will make you feel alone, it will try you, it will confuse you, it may even anger you--but if you beat it, it will give you a sense of accomplishment most modern games will never give you. The graphics are beautiful for a AA game release. You will see some problems. If the tree in BOTW bugged you, the trees here may too. There are seams in some textures--which I am hopeful they will work out in future patches. The creature textures are gorgeous--a little shiny in a few but scales reflect light more than rocks--though the movement of a few creatures are a bit wonky. But, hey, if that is your only complaint, you are doing quite well.Ambient sound shines. Dialogue is very well done--especially the narrator who reads the original 70s era text to you. When I first played it I thought the gain might have been a bit too high on a few things, but I adjusted easily enough.Controls are great, with two options. One is the traditional point and click controls like you would find in classic 90s Sierra Adventures. The other is WASD and Mouse, which is more modern and more familiar to me. I played with that setup. I did not try for a controller, but if it is not there, I would hope they add it in in future patches. As for negative, I only have one real thing to say. This game is not for everyone. If you thrive on needing others in your game with you, know this is a single player game only. It is spelunking a cave. You are alone almost the whole time. Encounters are rare as most of the game is exploring and finding your way through puzzles. This is a feature as the original game was built that way. If you can not handle a game designed that way, you will not like this game. If you are okay with that kind of challenge, or you grew up on microcomputer text adventures and/or classic graphic adventures from Sierra or Lucas Arts--then this game is calling out your name. My overall advice: Buy it. Play it. Beat it. Do something only a rare segment of the world has done: conquer the Colossal Cave.",Positive

1648,redfall,21-Jul-23,4,"I've played for 8 hours so far, some solo and some co-op. No major bugs, just occasional clipping and a couple of DCs. Looks good, atmospheric, is reasonably good fun to play. Some elements of Far Cry, some of Borderlands, lots of looting like in Warzone. Like in Far Cry 6, the enemies are not especially challenging - AI could use some tweaking. Ignore the haters bandwagon, it may not be the best game ever but I'd say it's a solid FPS that's more about fun than challenge. EDIT:Gave up after 30 hours. Repetitive, not much fun after a while, awkward combat, not satisfying enough to motivate me to want to play more. Not terrible, but not worth what I paid.

Who doesn't want a vampire shooting game made by Arkane? Unfortunately, reality sunk in during my time playing it... while the gunplay and some mechanics were fun to mess around with, the overall game was just... meh. The story wasn't great and well... the enemies were a bit too easy. The AI would get stuck in places, and the bosses were a ton easier than the normal vamp[ires that circled around the city. The NPCS also just didn't have dialogue unless they were important to the quest line. Most of them would just answer back with grunts and there was one that just straight-up ignores the players. The textures lacked a ton for a next-gen experience and for $70 slideshow cutscenes were definitely the last straw. Thankfully GamePass saved me $70 dollars, this game needed another year or two or just scrapped altogether because it wasn't the hit I thought it would be. Jacob and the gunplay are what save this from going lower on the score.

1683,redfall,14-May-23,2,"I'm actually sad about it. I love coop games, since playing with my friends is always a good experience in games like that - even when the game itself it's not actually good. Redfall is not even sustainable as a substructure to the fun. Why? simple enough. Poor gameplay. Its AI is horrendous. I remember playing smartphone games with smatter enemies than in this game. The skill tree is the definition of a ""modern rpg"", when the abilities do not actually matter and are overinflated to give you a sensation of a lot of content. The inventory is crazy bad. You gain a lot of weapons too fast and the overall experience is unbalanced, even on hard difficulty. Also, there's no need to work together since no actual treat requires that, so the abilities are kinda useless at some point. The only ok thing is the weapons design. Poor story. Most of it is told by static images - this game costs 70$ - and documents. No actual storytelling, I can assure you. NPC dialog? forget it. And how does the narrative influence the gameplay? oh, grab that and that, and that and bring it right here. That's it. Poor optimization. Alright, I'm already used to it since PC ports are usually bad in the generation. As a Ryzen 5 1600 owner, that actually gets worse since my CPU can't take some bad games. Even that, I never saw something run so bad on my PC. Jesus. Constant stuttering and FPS drop. I was playing at 25 fps sometimes, and reducing the graphics quality didn't do anything. The funny part is when you enter an underground map - separate from the open world - and the fps goes to 80 right away. I do not recommend this game.

1685,redfall,14-May-23,0,"Redial, the highly anticipated release from XYZ Studios, falls far short of its promise and is a prime example of a poorly executed video game. Despite its flashy marketing campaign and initial excitement, Redial fails to deliver on multiple fronts, leaving players frustrated, bored, and ultimately regretful of their purchase. One of the most glaring issues with Redial is its lackluster gameplay mechanics. The controls feel clunky and unresponsive, making even simple tasks a frustrating ordeal. The combat system, which should be a highlight of any action game, is marred by poor hit detection and repetitive animations. Instead of engaging battles that keep players on the edge of their seats, fights in Redial quickly become tiresome and predictable, lacking any depth or strategy. Furthermore, the game's storyline is convoluted and poorly developed. The narrative is riddled with plot holes, inconsistent character motivations, and a complete lack of emotional investment. The dialogue feels forced and unnatural, failing to establish any meaningful connections between the player and the game's world. It's a missed opportunity to create an immersive experience that players can truly get lost in. Visually, Redial is a disappointment as well. The graphics, touted as cutting-edge during the game's promotional campaign, are underwhelming and fail to impress. The environments lack detail and variety, making each level feel monotonous and uninspired. Character models suffer from stiff animations and lackluster design, further detracting from any potential visual appeal. To add insult to injury, Redial is riddled with technical issues. Frequent crashes, game-breaking bugs, and long loading times plague the experience, disrupting any semblance of enjoyment that players might have had. It's evident that the developers rushed the release without adequately addressing these critical problems, leading to a frustrating and unfinished game. Even the sound design in Redial is subpar. The music lacks depth and fails to create the intended atmosphere, often feeling like an afterthought rather than an integral part of the gaming experience. The voice acting, if present at all, is mediocre at best, with unconvincing performances that further contribute to the game's overall lack of immersion. A Disappointing Game Experience In conclusion, Redial is a highly disappointing game that fails to deliver on its promises. With its clunky gameplay mechanics, poorly developed storyline, lackluster visuals, technical issues, and subpar sound design, it's hard to find redeeming qualities in this title. Players are advised to steer clear of Redial and invest their time and money in more polished and engaging gaming experiences available on the market.",Negative

The shooting isn't really good either, especially since the enemy AI is braindead and you can literally walk up to enemies and one-shot them with a backstab (no sneaking required). Some enemies can't get around a vehicle and get stuck in an endless walking animation. Various items are highlighted with the prompt ""press E"" but are not usable in any way (such as small vehicles or even NPCs, this seems like some features were just cut last minute.

The first cut-scene is entirely unrelated to you or your character. I also don't understand what the music is trying to express at any point.

There are far too many problems bogging down Redfall to name here in a brief review (nobody will read)... but there is a slim chance... a glimmer of hope really... that this games most serious shortcoming could be resolved, and there's and even smaller chance the game could be good someday.

1735,redfall,5-May-23,4,"i fully complete this game in coop mode in 9 hours so probably I saw every aspect of this game and better way to describe this game is several words: ""buggy repetitive kinda chip gameplay"", now let's talk about all this little more. First of all lets talk about a significant part of the game and it is surprize surprize is bugs (nowadays it probably standard that game has some issues but this game has a lot of). in this game you can meet ""t-pose"" of characters and enemies, AI is also kinda broken that enemies on the location completely ignoring player, a lot of visual bugs with light system and LOD. And what interesting without this bugs game will stay OK and it perfect word to describe this game it kinda enjoyable and nothing more, game doesn't contain anything that can be eye catching or memorized. Yeah its co op open world but it feels kinda empty for it size and it really not so big. weapon system is also kinda strange some weapons has sub stats that can improve it stats but game doesn't show the base stats so message as increasing acc by 10% is kinda meaningless. Plot is also interest part of this game i mean it interest that devs also decide to save some money on cutscenes so it static pictures with copyright free music (at least it feels like it actually free). furthermore structure of the game looks like developers want to artificially stretch the playing time by make system like: open shelter, kill 3 minor boss to be able to kill mid level boss after you can do the same thing two more times and only after it you be able to kill final boss that actually can be killed by pressing F button 3 times. So who can enjoy this game ? probably someone who has gamepass to play it cheaper than 70$ and that person already completed every game on his list and just want to skip two evenings with his friend.for everyone else i don't think it that experience that expect player that saw ""from the creator of dishonored and prey"" in every trailer and price in 70$.",Negative

Writings litter the grounds, ammo and resources are easily replenished at the home base, the level design accommodates all players. I was shocked how very little the game asked of me to be creative, to find my own solution, to bring in my own tactics. I was raised in a household where I finished my plate, so I stubbornly pushed through to the end. I sincerely hope this doesn't drain any more resources from Arkane Austin and that they're given the green light to pursue another single-player, deliberately measured experience that welcomes and encourages player creativity and ingenuity to navigate its playspaces and engage with its obstacles.",Negative

1776,redfall,3-May-23,0,"Welp I won't lie by saying that the first time we saw the game being revealed, nobody was thinking this would be GOTY material. Still, Arkane Studios produced amazing games, even if none were 10 out of 10 (at least in my opinion). So let's start with this. First of all, I've refunded the game within the two hours I played it on Steam for a few reasons. Trying to play with a friend was a nightmare, not the one sold by the studio's sales pitches. Being disconnected on both sides, being logged out from the Arkane server, and the game simply crashing. When we manage to play for a little bit, we've met some of the wonkiest IA that even The Elder Scrolls couldn't fight for the crown. Either they just didn't bother attacking us, they ended up being iddle while being killed, or, worst scenario, they got stuck in an unkillable death loop (hehe, see the pun?) Sorry). The NPC weren't any better when it was possible to see them or when they weren't trying to intimidate us while t-posing. The last thing that bothered us (at least me) was that we ended up in his game and noticed that he was the only one being able to progress his save (MAJOR BUZZ KILL). So yeah, I went to look forward to playing at being horribly disappointed and lacking any faith when this was supposed to be a finished product that was pushed back to make sure everything was fine. It could have easily been released a year after the release today, and maybe, just maybe, it would have been a great game with the signature of Arkane magic. Clearly, this time the only magical moment I encountered was the moment my refund was allowed right away via Steam refund. All I can say is that not being able to play the game without issues every 5–10 minutes makes it impossible to review and even give a point to this. Arkane Studios (or Microsoft, I don't care who to blame TBH) deserve that massive L from the players to understand that releasing a product in such poor condition is not acceptable today, no matter if the game can be rented via Game Pass (which I love being a sub for from time to time) or paid the full price (like I did since I love to own my game). We have so many options today, from F2P games that are sometimes better than AAA games to indies to obviously major releases from big box stores, so how the hell did they think this was something that people wouldn't hold on to? Welp, this deserves a big zero, and I sure hope they'll move forward and fix the games with at least an apology to people who wanted to support them and enjoy a brand new IP. This will most likely be their last attempt at creating a brand new game.

1850,redfall,2-May-23,1,"RedFall ReviewRating: ★★☆☆☆RedFall, the highly anticipated game from a renowned studio, falls far short of expectations, failing to deliver an engaging and immersive experience. From its lackluster gameplay mechanics to its uninspired world design, this game left me feeling bored and unenthused.One of the biggest letdowns of RedFall is its gameplay. While the concept of battling vampires in an open-world setting sounded intriguing, the execution falls flat. The combat mechanics are repetitive and lack depth, with a limited variety of weapons and abilities that quickly become tiresome. The enemy AI is disappointingly simplistic, making encounters predictable and lacking any real challenge. It's a shame that a game centered around vampire slaying fails to create thrilling and intense gameplay moments.Moreover, the open-world design feels lifeless and uninteresting. The game world lacks meaningful exploration and fails to offer engaging side quests or activities to keep players invested. The environments lack variety and fail to captivate the imagination, resulting in a world that feels bland and forgettable.The narrative is another area where RedFall disappoints. The story fails to grip the player's attention or create a sense of urgency. The characters are poorly developed, lacking depth and relatability. The dialogue often falls into clichés and fails to evoke any emotional investment. It feels like a missed opportunity to create an immersive and compelling narrative within the vampire genre.Technical issues also plague RedFall. The game suffers from frequent glitches and performance problems, including frame rate drops and long loading times. These issues significantly hinder the overall experience and detract from any enjoyment that could have been found within the game.Furthermore, the multiplayer aspect, which was meant to be a highlight of RedFall, is underwhelming. The cooperative gameplay lacks innovation and fails to offer anything truly unique or exciting. It feels like a missed opportunity to create an engaging multiplayer experience that could have added replay value to an otherwise lackluster game .In conclusion, RedFall fails to live up to its potential, offering a dull and unremarkable gaming experience. The lackluster gameplay mechanics, uninspired world design, and underdeveloped narrative make for a forgettable game that fails to capture the imagination. Save your time and money and look elsewhere for a more engaging and enjoyable gaming experience .",Negative
1851,redfall,2-May-23,0,"I have played the game for more time than I wanted and I was bored to tears on how empty and devoid of fun it is. Not even a good experience as a shoot and loot game. Not a good experience as an open world. Poor ai, poor controls, input lag, low performance, bugs, clipping, lack of interactivity, lack of story, even cutscenes, interesting characters are nowhere to be found. It’s a mess…This is an embarassment of a game. It should have never been launched in this state. Not even a AA by this point. It looks like something a small studio with big ambitions would make. Xbox continues to churn out trash and trick their consumers. The trailers we’ve seen for this game have all been substantially altered and scripted which gives out the unrealistic idea that this is a much better game then it actually is. A case where expectation vs reality is lost. I regret buying an xbox and giving microsoft a second chance (more like tenth chance). I’m not even hoping that starfield will be that good and this is proof that microsoft should stop buying studios an publishers and start getting their act together with what they have.…",Negative

If I'd paid money for this then I'd be wanting it back, as it is Gamepass made it just a waste of my time to try. The main issues for me were that for a lootershooter the loot available quickly loses any incentive and the shooting is never exciting. The gameplay loop got stale very, very quickly. Poor combat, poor AI, no real sense of exploration, a nagging feeling that the open world has gone from trying to create jump scares into just sterile emptiness, weird design decisions on multiplayer (only host progresses, really? It's 2023), and then layer on animation glitches and other engine streaming hiccups and occasional stuttering... My goodwill evaporated rather quickly. Strengths are the little story telling moments within the world, but these are so smothered by having to design around a co-op looter shooter, and that there are moments of fun to be found with a friend in combining skills traversing and clearing areas.

All they do is damage the xbox community by defending a game that is, quite simply, indefensible. Guys, you need to accept the criticisms. This game not only didn't live up to expectations, which I think were set too high considering how bad the trailers looked, but also it's pure rubbish. Mediocre visuals, mediocre performance, mediocre story, mediocre length, mediocre variety, mediocre single player experience (when they told us it was primordially thought as a single player game, with a multiplayer mode), mediocre experience when you need to be connected to the internet all the time to play the game, etc. It's all bad news with this game! And you know what? It's 70 bucks! The only thing that's a bit fun is the multiplayer, but for just a couple of short hours.

The game is terribly optimized, and the framerate is constantly chugging in just about every situation. This feels more like a choppy Xbox One game from 2014 than a complete ""AAA"" game from 2023.

Hace 30 años esto no pasaba y ya basta que estas compañías nos estén viendo como peones y beta testers para al cabo de 6 meses tener el juego como debió haber salido. Redfall es un Triple A que no aporta nada, no innova, si lo comparamos con un FPS como Crysis del 2007 o Far Cry 2, estos se comen vivo a Redfall en cuanto a mecánicas, diversión, jugabilidad y físicas. Qué un título Triple A del 2023 siga haciendo lo mismo que FPS de la década de los 128 bits es una vergüenza inaceptable. Las fallas del juego van desde su código fuente y desde su concepto y como se planteó el juego en la pre-producción. Esto no se va a arreglar con parches, porque tendrían que hacer lo mismo que hizo Square Enix con el Final Fantasy XIV, que lo tuvieron que rehacer de nuevo y relanzarlo. Aquí esa posibilidad no va a existir porque Redfall se va a convertir en el primer título deficiente de Arkane. No lo compres a menos de que esté a menos de 10 USD si únicamente te mola el concepto de los vampiros. De todas formas lo tienes en el Gamepass y lo puedes probar desde allí y vas a concordar con la mayoría de las notas de los usuarios con este título tan decepcionante.",Negative

1905,redfall,2-May-23,1,"I recently got a new laptop that came with a free month of games pass which is how I was able to play this game. However, I would not recommend anyone play this game at all and just simply skip it in general. The game utilizes 17GB of VRAM at 1440p with DLSS. I was shocked to see that this game was reaching the VRAM limit of my desktop 4090, I tried lowering the graphics from Ultra to High but that didn't change a single thing, and left me wondering if there is a memory leak somewhere in the game that is causing this. Because I for sure am not seeing amazing visuals for that utilization, a game like Tomb Raider 2013 or even Titanfall 2 looks a lot better than this. Gameplay is very mediocre and boring, sure the premise of the game is to run around and defeat vampires but it gets super tedious in the long run. Another thing I dislike is how most of the weapons feel and fire the same way, yes the amount of damage each gun would do is different but the feel of using them in-game is just the same across. The story is meh as well, I only played for 2-3 hrs so can't give a concise answer on that front but it doesn't seem to be interesting. Overall I would not recommend anyone pay $70 for this game, let alone not get GamePass just for this game. This is one title that should be skipped",Negative

The missions and side content the infiltration and mystique. Coming from someone that has been a Hardcore Arcane fan since playing Dishonored on the Xbox 360 and have been playing everything since. It is heartbreaking to see a game that feels like it should have been their first outing where they learned all of their mistakes and would build up to Dishonored and Prey. However unfortunately that is not the case. While playing you even feel that it is a freshman outing as the graphics are worse than Dishonored and it came out in 2012. I haven't quite completed it yet but with as easy as the AI is to fool that shouldn't take long as I am using the same stealth approaches I used in the previous games and I can pretty much take out all the humans and then clean up the vampires without much more than an occasional Yellow question mark.",Negative

The main character mentions a theatre in the gameplay trailer saying ""i used to go here all the time"" implying that shes the regular Morb fan who always went to theatre when it was morbing time thus getting extraordinary powers from not pirating Morbius and enjoying it in cinemas everytime Now together they must destroy the morb thirsty vampires before they eradicate every Morb on planet earth making Morbius a forgotten gem it is a theory that Phil Spencer himself gave the order to delay the game and cancel the Playstation port cause Sony refused to put Morbius in the game and Spencer decided that he would include the cinema that he himself is highly dedicatedSpencer sharing my vision of the Morbius movie ive come to realise Redfall is one of if not the best games ever made and its the closest thing we can get to a Morbius game thus i give this game a clear 100/10.

1931,redfall,2-May-23,3,"Ich mag Arkane eigentlich.Ihre Games sind immer auf gewisse Weise eigen, aber spaßig.Grafisch gesehen waren ihre Games nie die Oberliga, aber der Stil passte zum jeweiligen Game, hässlich waren sie nie. Aber dennoch war da immer das Gameplay, welches alles wieder ausgeglichen hat. Doch Redfall versagt auf allen Linien für mich. Grafisch ist es grottig, selbst bei maximalen Details. Stellenweise sogar schlechter als ""Dishonored 2"". Was für mich nicht schlimm wäre (Gameplay > Grafik). Aber das Gameplay ist ebenso schwach. - Das Gunplay fühlt sich nicht gut an. Gegner sind meist Bulletsponges und typische ""RPG-Like"" Abschüsse mit HP-Balken - Nicht so schlimm, wie in Fallout (hier sind Headshots zumindest bei den meisten Twinks insta-Kill), aber dennoch nervig. Den meisten Waffen fehlt die Wucht. - Die Open World ist langweilig. Zu 90% der Zeit läuft man durch leere, tote Landschaften, hin und wieder plättet man eine Gegner-Gruppe oder findet die ein oder andere kleine Notiz. Der selbe Schwachsinn wie bei ""Generation Zero"". Ja, es ist keine typische ""Kazillion-Fragezeichen-Türme-Erkletter-Ubisoft-Welt"", aber ganz leer sollte diese auch nicht sein. - Die Story kann absolut nicht mitreißen. - Die Fähigkeiten sind ganz cool, aber pro Charakter zu wenige, um wirklich coole Builds zu ermöglichen; Mir fehlt die Freiheit, wie bei Dishonored. - Laut Arkane im Solo spielbar, ist es dennoch spürbar auf Ko-op ausgerichtet. Zu oft begegnet man Gegner-Gruppen, die für einen Spieler alleine zu viel sind; viel zu viele Mechaniken behindern einen Solo-Run einfach nur, Stand jetzt fühlt sich das Game für mich wie ein stark heruntergebrochener Loot-Shooter an, wie eine BETA von einem Destiny-Klon., nein, eher sogar wie eine Alpha davon. Und besonders enttäuscht mich dabei, dass ich von Arkane besseres gewohnt bin. Wie kann es sein, dass das Game grafisch schlechter aussieht, als Deathloop, welches 2 Jahre vorher erschien? Wieso übernimmt Arkane nicht alte Stärken aus Prey, Deathloop und Dishonored und macht stattdessen so ein aus der Zeit gefallenes 08/15 Loot-Shooter-Ding draus? Bin nur froh, es nicht GEKAUFT zu haben, sondern über den Gamepass zu spielen. Werde es aber vermutlich zeitnah wieder deinstallieren - Spaß macht es mir nicht wirklich.",Negative

The story is structured and presented as an early 90s action film, perhaps as a means of making the younger versions of its now aged cast make more sense, but it unfortunately also has all of the poor representation, objectification, and ham-fisted dialogue those movies are known for, And not even in a fun way. There is also a forced attempt to be “wacky” that doesn’t do the game any favors.

There are some problems, like with the AI, but overall I find it very enjoyable. I think of the game as a light version of Payday giving off GTA vibes but very different with its separated missions. Crime Boss has some good gimmicks and bad ones like a bad random event starting missions in middle of a firefight. Some of the AI actions will frustrate players as well but overall I'm very happy and I like that the game doesn't take itself too seriously and there is an interesting diverse cast of characters. I'm a little disappointed as some gameplay is getting in the way of completing objectives and I wish there was an option to join a friend's campaign as a hired team member, but overall I am loving the game after tens of hours and plan to continue playing. Crime Boss will offer good options on stealth and customizing your character's weapons but if you're happy with repeating the campaign, interested in how to find out alternative steps to find new missions, and especially if you have someone to try this game with I hope people give it a chance. DLC when?",Positive

1954,crime-boss-rockay-city,2-Apr-23,4,"I heard about this game in December 2022, and since the trailer was so well done, I was eagerly anticipating it with hope and joy... Let me say straight away that my hopes were pretty much dashed in less than 2 hours of gameplay. After completing the tutorial and making progress in the campaign, my verdict on the single-player experience is extremely mixed. It's very reminiscent of Payday 2 (at this point, one could even call it plagiarism) in remastered 2023, which means it's graphically pumped up on steroids and simplified to the extreme in terms of management and gameplay. The campaign feels like a dud, the kind of high-budget Hollywood action movie that's overacted by the actors and in which you participate in a few action scenes that are ultimately pointless. The budget seems to have been absorbed by the cast, which may be the only positive aspect of the game when it's forgotten in 6 months. There's no creativity in the gameplay or the story; it's all very basic. The actors overplay their parts, it's a real flop. However, it could become a cult classic, and at times I wondered if the entire scripted part was meant to be a big joke. What a waste for these good '90s action stars who seem lost in this production. But let's get back to the gameplay. It's not an open world, you can't explore the city, you can only choose missions in a particular location, and it's always the same: infiltration, action, extraction... In Payday 2, during the extraction phase, we sometimes, or even often, had an accident, and we had to transfer the loot from the crashed van to a new vehicle, which added extra tension at the end of the heist. We never knew if we were going to get away ""easy"" or if we were going to have to face the police again, in the middle of an intersection, next to a park. But there's none of that in Crime Boss. In Rockay City, the cops mind their own business. In short, I'm very disappointed at the moment. As for multiplayer, I get the impression that you can only play with your Epic friends, not with random guys... I still hope that the developers will improve the game in the future or that the rest of the single-player campaign will be better than its beginning. Even though what I've seen is lackluster, the game has considerable potential, and if the developers add the missing features, it could become a reference. In conclusion, here's my advice: if you like Payday 2, stick with it; if you don't like Payday 2, you won't like Crime Boss (it's the same gameplay, with ultra-simplified complexity, wrapped in modern graphics and a poorer story); and if you don't know Payday 2, wait for the third opus, which should come out this year. Today, I give it a 4/10 for the cast, Kim Basinger, the graphics, and the technical execution (I haven't encountered any bugs yet). I'll revise my rating later based on my continued experience with the game.",Negative

1958,crime-boss-rockay-city,31-Mar-23,8,"When you actually play the game, it is surprisingly fun. Don’t get me wrong, there are issues with writing, gameplay variety - but some of these could be improved in updates. One of the biggest issues is that developers don’t properly explain all game elements and mechanics. Fun came when you understand how to play this game. For example  reviewers criticizing stealth probably don’t know all options they have. In addition to stealth takedowns (which are unreliable sometimes), you can disable cameras and then use shouting + zip-tying for crowd control, which is applicable also to guards.Campaign have novel ideas and is both challenging and fun. I like rogue-like elements, not enough variability and writing is the biggest issue. I hope there will be higher difficulty available.FPS part is not good nor bad. AI and weapon impacts (injuries) could be better.Multiplayer is great with friends (as in other coop games), I really enjoyed concept of unlocking unique characters by playing chains for 3 stars. My biggest issue is again lack of variety and in this case also long term progression.Final words - I would give harsher review if this game is for full price.

It feels like youre shooting some zombies with guns. Gunplay itself is otherwise ok.Even in multiplayer, you play CO-OP against these dumb AI enemies, which is not very entertaining. I dont understand why cant you play story campaign in CO-OP. This is just lazy.Rogue-like mechanics in the single player mode is supposed to be one the selling points of this game.

1961,crime-boss-rockay-city,30-Mar-23,2,"Such wasted potential. This was supposed to be that game that isn't totally great, but is a guilty pleasure like the 1990 action movies. But it's been a terrible disappointment. The actors are the main attraction, but they don't act, they recite lines that are extremely boring, with no ideas and not a shred of humor. Except for Michael Rooker who at least tried. Which is a big shame because we know that games can incorporate real actors well see Keanu Reeves, Christopher Judge etc. and it's a breath of fresh air to games. Gameplay is boring, repetitive, no fun, frustrating. In two hours you get to the same area in multiple missions, but the difference is the safe is in a different location and there are more enemies. The AI in the game just doesn't exist. You have partners who do absolutely nothing and 20 cops charging at you headlong. No tactics, no stealth gameplay (you can try, but it still usually turns into a headless gunfight) The rogue-like element is interesting, but not in this game. If you play 6-8 hours and then have to do it all over again, same lame dialogue, same missions. The idea of a 4 minute mission is interesting, but not so much when you then have to click through the menu for crap and spend another 5-10 minutes there. Then Dialogue, mission, menu and repeat over and over again. The cinematography is terrible, where you jump from actor to actor and the feeling is bad. The music is well chosen but poorly used. There is so much music in the 90's and they only pick six licensed ones. One of the few things that isn't so bad is gun play. Not excellent, but good. Maybe a couple of missions where you don't steal are mildly interesting We'll see what the developers and studio do with those problems. At the moment it's a lot worse payday, but even payday wasn't in the best shape in the very beginning and it took a while to get it to where it is today, so maybe there's hope for Crime Boss, but there's a long way to go. In current state, this game simply cannot be recommended.",Negative
1962,crime-boss-rockay-city,30-Mar-23,8,"So I just brought the game and i like it. Yes its so bad that its actually good. It has some potential to be good only if they spent more time on gameplay and not the cast. The cast is a dream but the voice acting is terrible. Especially Chuck Norris who gives the worst voice acting ever in a video game. I would have rather Steven Segal but even he would give something worst so I can deal with Chuck Norris but he's very cringe. Michael Madsen is okay but they should have gotten actual video game voice actors. I feel they could have just gotten the likeness from these people and have actually voice actors like how they did in Scarface: The World Is Yours. Just get the likeness and have better voice actors. Madsen sounds like smokey the bear smoked 30 packs of cigarettes per hour. The combat is okay but could be better. I feel that all FPS' should be like COD or Battlefield, weapons have too much recoil. I understand that guns in real life have recoil as I have shot a 9mm and 7.52x51mm rifle so I know those guns go bam. But its overexaggerated in this game. Guns are hard to control. I haven't had any bugs or glitches so far. The tutorial was very helpful as I am using a controller for this run and I'll do my KBM for my next. The permadeath is exciting and makes you be more cautions with how you move in the game. Can't go all Rambo which is good. But you lose health too quickly which isn't something I like. I feel like they could have did it like COD with no health bar and like Uncharted.  They should have made it open world and added a TPS view. There is so much potential here but they needed to at least delay the game till next year. Cast is great but they needed to spend more time on the gameplay.

1973,crime-boss-rockay-city,30-Mar-23,7,"Although certainly rough around the edges now, Crime Boss is an otherwise interesting and fun single-player oriented take on the PAYDAY formula, offering both cooperative heists and a dedicated single-player roguelite campaign. Pros: + A full-fledged roguelite story mode revolving around taking over the Miami-inspired city, offering turf war elimination matches, heists to finance our criminal empire, and some occasional scripted story missions. The available opportunities (and muscles to hire) slightly differ with each playthrough, offering a slightly different experience for each run, even though the roguelite gameplay basics remain the same. During each run, our protagonist gains XP, unlocking new skills with each level up, making subsequent runs slightly easier to progress through by buffing our protagonist, our gang's cash flow and general strength, or the quality of equipment and muscle we can buy. + The two co-op modes are also serviceable, with Quick Play being similar to the Crime.NET screen of PAYDAY2 (offering the same heists we encounter in Story Mode in a standalone fashion), while Urban Legends being more akin to the multi-day heists of PAYDAY2 and the grand heists of GTA Online, each spanning three levels. + Some minor gameplay enhancements compared to PAYDAY2. For example, we can temporarily speed up the speed of our drills, or can unlock doors via dedicated minigames. We can also carry up to two loot bags at the same time, although in that case, we are restricted to our sidearm. + The visuals are okay, the city really conveys that 90s Florida setting pretty well. + All-around performance is also acceptable. I'm running the game on a rig with a i7-4790 CPU, a GTX 1070 VGA and 32 gigs of RAM, on a 2560x1080 ultrawide resolution, with the High detail preset. With this setting, I only experience some occasional hiccups during larger battles. + AI companions are serviceable, being able to loot the goodies independently, pick up dropped loot bags, or deliver them to the escape van on their own. We can also order them to follow us or stay put, and can seamlessly switch into them whenever needed. Granted, if we want to stealth, they may not be reliable, but they serve the single player campaign well enough. + All-around stealth is easier than it is in PAYDAY2. We have an unlimited amount of zipties and bodybags available, while guards don't wear pagers, so as long we can divert/separate them from other NPCs, it's easy to dominate and tie them up without trouble. We can also move tied NPCs around. Cons: - Writing and voice acting is horrendous. Chuck Norris' performance is probably the worst VA I've ever heard in a video game. Michael Madsen at least tries putting in a performance, but in his case, it's really off-putting to hear a 35-40 years old protagonist talking with the voice of a 65 years old guy. The game also doesn't have separate stealth and loud voice lines, meaning that you dominate guards by shouting at them (undetected) even when in stealth. - Gunplay is serviceable, but could be a lot better. You can't really ""feel"" any of the guns, and most of them feature really annoying bloom - it's hard to land shots even with semi-automatic pistols and rifles. - Lone wolfs might be bothered by the fact that even though you can play the Quick Play and Urban Legends heists solo with bots, you cannot create private lobbies. As such, if you don't fill the slots with bots, others can easily join in. Also, as I understand, the co-op game modes don't have any special rewards, you can only unlock the higher-level characters in them for story play. - Customization is only rudimentary, with each character being able to wield a two-handed weapon, a sidearm, and a special gadget (e.g. a number of throwable rocks or bricks). - Map variety is also not the game's forte, as all three game modes seemingly sharing the same combat map pool of roughly ~two dozen levels, with some minor randomization during each run (affecting guard patrols and camera placement). This, however, could change in the future. Summary: TL;DR, I like the game, and I think it worth the discounted AA price it cost during the preorder campaign, but it can certainly use some additional polish, a redesign of the rudimentary customization features, and extra robbery/heist maps. Still, if you are looking for a primarily single-player PAYDAY experience set in an over-the-top 1990s setting, you can definitely take a look at the game. :)",Average

Instead of monsters, Sauron's main home is ruled by humans.

2035,star-trek-resurgence,6-Jun-23,6,"PC - RTX4080. Having been a long time Trekkie I discovered this by accident while scrolling the Epic store and decided to by it on a whim as the reviews looked good. Now I don't usually either pre order or purchase games at release as I've been burned before (Arkham Knight i'm looking at you!) but I thought sod it, it can't be that bad... oh how wrong I was! Graphically this is nothing to shout about, it's done in Telltale's sudo comic book style (as the devs are ex TT staff) which I could accept as adequate if it wasnt for the god awful lack of graphical options. Who builds a game in 2023 with no native widescreen support? FML it is painful trying to get this working on a 4k monitor. But even if you can get it to play with your display it won't matter as the game will be locked to 30FPS (again in 2023!!!) for some unfathomable reason. Why? I mean it's not as if the Unreal Engine can't handle it especially as it looks like a PS3 era game. Next is the character movement and facial animations. Holy **** on a stick, for a narrative heavy point and click based game the lack of fluidity in movement and the comical facial expressions actually take you out of the moment more often than drawing you in. Following on from that **** show is the sound, or lack there of. I'm sure there are some interesting conversations to be had in this game. I couldn't tell you though as I can't hear any of them through the clipped audio and horrendous lip syncing issues. Gameplay wise, it's serviceable. You're here for the story, which is actually really good, but you keep getting interupted by random QTE which often break the immersion of a scene and are usually just filler. Oh and if you ever wanted to know if being in phaser dual is exciting... if this game is anything to go by the answer is nope. It is instead just mildly annoying. Much like the controls and oh my god the motion blur! Just give me options for graphics and controls!!! So you may think at this point that I think ST:R is a POS? Well currently, in it's bug riddled, half arsed, comically broken state, yes it is. The only thing that is saving it is the story. If they can address the major bugs with a patch then i'll give it another go just to see the story though, as it really is that good.

I anticipated it would be yet more cynical dystopian Trek, the antithesis of what Trek should be. Thankfully, I was wrong, I was VERY wrong. In terms of ST games this is probably one of the best from a narrative perspective, being put into the shoes of two characters, one a senior bridge officer and the other a lower decks Petty Officer working the hum drum engineering jobs of the ship. Each have their own unique perspective and effect on the story. I have to say I absolutely loved every minute of the story. It was a very well paced, intelligent story that presents the player with a wide array of choices, putting you at the heart of the ST universe. This is like the classic Trek of old where the line of right and wrong is walked, there are ethical and moral quandaries to consider and solve and (if you are so inclined) how to a Starfleet Officer should conduct themselves. That combined with very deep and well written characters it brings this game to life. I had an absolute blast with this. From a technical standpoint its not incredible, if I had to be harsh, the characters are basically from the Sims4 and the graphical performance is very mid but to be frank, thats not what this game is about. The graphics and character models are perfectly serviceable to get you through an incredibly enjoyable and story rich ""Telltale"" style game. I am sad that I have played the game and have finished it, I wish I could do it all again and enjoy it all over again. This is basically the only game in recent memory that I am absolutely desperate to see get a sequel and the Studio will have my money if that comes to pass. A must play for TNG era trekkies, this game is phenomenal as a ST game if a little rough round the edges.",Positive

And knowing what the industry is like; cut an indie dev some slack! Odds are they had to get something out the door by a certain time or else forfeit whatever percentage of pay they were contracted.

The feel and story fit that timeline very well. It isn't a particularly challenging game, though there is some combat, it has a story mode if those combat portions prove difficult. The main appeal is making tough choices and seeing how they play out. The choices you make will bring some characters closer to the playable characters while others may distance themselves. The medium they tell the story in is very, very fitting for Star Trek. Once patches are released and the small technical issues fixed, this will be a 10/10 game. Highly recommend!",Positive

After all it's a platform-adventure game set in a world(s) with a whole spectrum of colors which can't be boring, right?... Wrong. There is nothing innovative, nothing original in its gameplay, story, or anything else, except the graphics. Yes, I admit that the graphic quality is at another level than the previous SpongeBob titles. But that means too little for a game with a level design unoriginal - I feel like playing again BFBB-Rehydrated - and unfit for a keyboard & mouse. I'm mention here only the PC version input devices where other options are missing. Game Settings and the UI are other disappointments for me. UI is not very handy to browse it, while the options for video and control settings are missing. And, personally, I found the game story pretty dull with those ideas of already overused multi / pocket universe concept.Sadly there is not much to say about the positive aspects of the game. Well, I say it once again that the graphics are of a higher quality than any of the previous games of the series. Both thumbs up for that.

I also really liked the fact that there is no need to look for shovels scattered throughout the location for plot advancement. The graphics have become much better compared to the first part. The music has also become more complex and advanced, I can't help but praise the developers for it. And yes, finally SpongeBob is fighting with someone normal, and not with robots (already tired of so many games). As for the disadvantages: it was disappointing that you can only control SpongeBob. Due to the reduced number of playable characters, SpongeBob becomes too strong and pumped up compared to the first part (looks a little silly) In particular, I can attribute the number of locations to the disadvantages. I think it would be possible to do one or two more. Well, as it is, the game is beautiful, head and shoulders above the first part.

2055,spongebob-squarepants-the-cosmic-shake,3-Feb-23,7,"This was a pleasant surprise. Although I never played the original BFBB as a kid. I did play the sequel which was The Movie Game. I was hoping for a Movie Game Remake. But I can understand, that it was probably better to a new game. But as the 4th game in the BFBB series, it surprisingly stacks up well. But I can't help but feel that it doesn't go that much above it's peers. The problem is that like the other games in this series, people who enjoy SpongeBob are the ones who is will get the most out of this game. At it core, it's a pretty good platformer. But is nothing outstanding. Another issue is that it also doesn't really brings any improvements that BFBB sequels had. Like the upgrade system from The Movie Game. In fact it even sort of regress from BFBB. The collectables are just used for costumes. They are not tied to progression or even again the upgrade systems from The Movie Game. What's worse is that Patrick and Sandy are not playable. I know they weren't as fleshed out as SpongeBob in BFBB. But The Movie Game addressed that issue. Sandy was removed, but they made Patrick more fleshed in that game. But in defense, they did give SpongeBob more abilities to make up for that. These abilities are really fun to use. I even like they are some shortcuts you can take if you think outside the box. The levels are very fun and creative. This game clearly has a lot of effort put into it. But despite it's simplicity, I couldn't put this game down. The only real issue here is that there are some bugs and some poorly thought out moments. It is definitely worth playing if you like SpongeBob.",Average

2069,elderand,22-Feb-23,8,"Feels like a very classic metroidvania; relatively simple and even a bit clunky, but in a good way, and so is very reminiscent of oldschool Castlevania games. Despite not reinventing the wheel in that genre, pretty much everything this game sets out to do, it does well. Great variety of weapons, magic, bows, armors, shields, items, etc. Everything feels super useful and varied aside maybe from a few consumables that are forgetable. The sense of exploration is great and intuitive, the unlockable abilities are super fun, so is the platforming, the combat is engaging (especially the fast bosses), there are tons of secrets to uncover, and the music is also quite amazing! The visuals leave a bit to be desired (some areas do stand out however!), but maybe that's only because I'm a huge fan of Blasphemous which set the bar VERY HIGH for pixel art and metroidvanias. Also it's a bit baffling that most of the text displayed is straight up in Times New Roman, making the dialogue and hints prompts feel unfinished when they're actually.. not. The story is also kinda meh. Cryptic and fine to ignore, but it does lead to great visual moments both in terms of areas to explore and boss designs. All and all, great little indie game for sure.A joy to 100% complete on my first playthrough, and will definitely play again",Positive

The game features haunting music and sound effects, as well as incredibly disturbing monster designs. Combat is intense and requires strategy, as you must use your Camera Obscura to capture the souls of the malevolent spirits that lurk in the shadows.

Like the company itself, it's no where near the top level. More glorified Indie wrestling televised and should be treated as such with video games too. At most you would want to pay $20, or $10 to be realistic. Even as a diehard AEW fan, waiting until it is discounted is the smart path. Even as a anti-wwe fan, there are other Wrestling games available aside from WWE2k23 and this, that you can put your money towards. If you are buying it for the nostalgia of the old wrestling game days, this isn't that. Better to just get a copy of No Mercy. There is little here to do. The game started out as a mobile template that was upped to a console standard. There was little care taken into the development when it comes to the animations [root motion is poorly used], modelling [obvious], effects [basic], collisions [worse than 2k20...] and of course gameplay is atrocious with little replay value. Creative suite is a joke that appears to have been a purchased 3rd party product that they then included into the game. AEW marketed this as a Arcade Wrestling game. If they marketed it as a Party game or Wrestling party game even, it could get a higher score. As the party side is more prevalent than the Wrestling side. Arcade Wrestling games still exist. Action Wrestling Arcade for instance is quite decent. To finish: If you want to support AEW by blindly buying this, would still recommend waiting until it is a better price.",Negative

2114,aew-fight-forever,2-Jul-23,3,"Pretty damn bad. I don't give it a 2, because at least it works and is functional in the most basic of ways. I've now played 6.5 hours of it (no DLC purchased), but it's hard to keep going as there's not much else to do. The graphics and models are some of the worst I've seen in the last few years for a release of this supposed size—actual early PS3-level graphics. Smackdown Vs. Raw 2007 on the Xbox 360 (the first wrestling game to be in HD) looks 10x better than this. A game released 15 years ago blows AEW Fight Forever out of the water in the graphical department. The controls and gameplay when you're on the attack are decent, but kicking out and reversing are broken, and it's all up to luck. The game feels floaty to play and buggy at points. The creation suite is sad for a game in 2023. It looks promising at first, but as you look further and further into it, it's barebones in comparison to 2K, MDickie games, and Fire Pro World. Having no Community Creations is actually laughable (Yes, you CANNOT share creations online...). Not only that, but any actual CAW you make (even with formulas) looks AWFUL. The match types are a joke. I counted 6 or 7. Again, SvR 07 that's going to be 16 years old soon had waaay more match types. No full entrances either! That is probably on the level of a PS1 game... The Career/Story mode seems promising at first, but it's like they didn't have time to expand on it and after 2 hours it's just a borefest of nothing to offer. As a wrestling fan, I'm extremely disappointed. The developers and company hyped the game to be an old school wrestling game brought into a new era of gaming, but in reality it's a barebones video game that gets nothing accomplished like the old AKI games did and doesn't bring anything new to the table. It's like they forgot we're headed into 2024. Yes, you can base your gameplay and style on older games but... how about changing stuff up to reflect we're in a new age where people demand more? We're not paying 30 bucks for the game, it's a full priced AAA title, isn't it??? It's a product sold solely on the nostalgia of their fans and it's shameful the amount of DLC there is already. I will not continue to play this and I'm saddened I purchased it on release and fell into the hype.",Negative

2116,aew-fight-forever,1-Jul-23,10,"This is the best wrestling game I have played in a very long time. It is a faithful recreation and modernization of the AKI engine. The long wait and lack of content (for now) are due to the developers animating all the moves by hand, which is time-consuming compared to the motion capture of most modern sports games. It was a labor of love, and it hits the ball out of the park where it counts; the gameplay. The graphics are charming and help define the vibe of this game. Video games don't have to look like real life to be good or visually appealing—examples: WWF No Mercy, Super Mario Bros. 3, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Pong, etc. I can't wait to see what AEW Games has lined up for this title in the future, and I am hopeful there will be a stampede of content coming. I received a review copy for this review.",Positive

It is a polished, 2023 version of those games, and is an arcade game through and through. That said, it still has TONS of over the top content, such as 49 weapons, blood and gore galore,  a completely interactive and destructible environment around the ring, hidden unlockable wrestlers in the story mode, NO VIRTUAL CURRENCY YOU PURCHASE WITH REAL MONEY (hello 2K?), and extra content that will allow you to create facsimiles of NJPW wrestlers and some missing AEW talent. And the Title Belts change hands if you beat the champions in SP Exhibition, so I already have all the real, current AEW champions with their actual belts (including a Toni Storm that I had to create myself). The geeks giving this game a ZERO are either comparing it too much to WWE 2K23, which is a simulation of the TV shows, or they're just toxic WWE trolls (they're like the Snyder fans of wrestling).

2119,aew-fight-forever,30-Jun-23,10,"I'm going to review this not as a fanboy, but as a fan of wrestling games. Mechanically, it blows WWE 2K out of the water. The wrestling feels like homage to 'No Mercy' and I say that in the best way possible. WWE 2K's Irish Whip for instance is almost completely incoherent whereas Fight Forever's works perfectly proving that 2K's realistic graphics actually hampers the mechanics greatly. WWE 2K wins in terms of production value, but AEW wins in terms of wrestling which also happens to be a similar comparison to the real-life TV shows. AEW should start a tournament scene for the game and get a community going for it to outshine the negative reviews that only highly rate blockbuster games like God of War. Fight Forever is a FANTASTIC foundation to build on, and overall, it's more fun than slow, overly realistic 2K games.",Positive
2120,exoprimal,29-Jul-23,8,"""Exoprimal"" is a visually impressive multiplayer-only game developed by Capcom using the RE engine.

The story isn't a reboot, reskin, rehash, or remaster, so that naturally boosts its score a couple of points with me. Shooting dinosaurs is fun! Shooting players in pvp is seldom if ever fun, and this game is no exception. If you are on the fence about this game, give it a try - but give it a try for about 10 matches.

2127,exoprimal,23-Jul-23,3,What a mess. It feels like each department was working separately on each element. There's a plot but it's told through videos in a multiplayer game so if you're in a group at slightly different levels of progression each match is followed by 1 or 2 of.ypu watching a video while everyone else is just waiting for you. Ignoring that that gameplay is mostly fine. Work together. Use giant mechs to kill lots of dinos. But it is quickly repetitive. Every mission feels the same. No idea how well the PvP aspect is balanced. Each match seems to boil down to 15 minutes of identical gameplay and then one team wiping out the other and winning the final.point. Third person camera is frustrating. The big tanks are a pain to be around as they can block your entire screen but avoiding them means not working together.,Negative
2128,exoprimal,22-Jul-23,8,"The game itself is a PvEvP mission-based hero shooter. Point of the game is to work with oyur team to complete objectives for a malevolent AI and their summoned hordes of dinos. As a standalone game, you could do a lot worse as it offers a unique bit of gameplay, the 9 classes all play a bit differently from one another even though they mainly fall within the holy trinity of dps, tank, and heals, and the progression through each match varies a bit each time through. Combat and gameplay also feels pretty smooth. Characters have a little bit of personality, and the storyline, while starting a bit slow, does pick up well for the climax battle at the end. That being said, there are some issues. There is only one main game mode, Dino Survival, where you need to play over and over again to progress in the story, which can feel very repetitive. Random teams also don't know what classes others are playing until they are in the match, and matchmaking doesn't balance roles from the get go, so if one gets stuck with a poor team comp and noone changes to a needed role, the already repetitive matches can feel like a miserable slog. Some missions also force direct PvP even if PvE preference is selected, which really can feel rough for some, especially given how the nature of PvP begets the worst kinds of people. Limitations aside, what they do have feels very polished. There are minimal bugs, and servers have been quite stable from the release. The PvE race aspect of the game is quite fun, and the raid bosses, which pit all 10 players in the match against waves of enemies along with some specialty super dinos, feel challenging and have a lot of a fun factor. The price point is also a little cheaper than the current $70 trend + $30+ season pass for games as it comes at a $50 base game cost. Is it worth it at the release price? Ehhh, maybe. Really depends on if they follow through on the post-release addition promises. Definitely worth it if on sale though. Overall though, one can certainly do worse when it comes to an arcadey class-based mission shooter. Far too many are comparing it to games like Overwatch where the only similarity is that the characters are class-based (with 1-2 classes being amalgamations of multiple other classes). Honestly, the game really should be taken at it's own merits as it does find itself it's own niche, and it certainly has future potential.",Positive

Almost everry match is different and the objectives have a big variety. Combat is also really good, both in pve and pvp. Comebacks are common (as others said it's not possible in this game - that's nonsense). I wouldn't pay 60 bucks for it (i only would pay that much for AAA titles with next gen graphics and story) but it's a really good game for game pass or on sale.",Positive

But once you get to the first real boss, the Neo T-Rex, this game becomes a legitimate blast!The story is so ridiculous, that it gives me the same joy I get from watching a B action movie. It's goofy but I still feel invested.Being a full price game while having a battle pass definitely leaves a bad taste however and the UI has a lot to be desired.

2142,exoprimal,19-Jul-23,3,"I want to start this off by saying I love Capcom. They have been unable to do any wrong lately. But everyone trips and this is theirs. Exoprimal is, simply put, a pretty game with fun gameplay for a few hours and then it's boring. Yes, new maps and objectives unlock as you play but which one you'll get is random and the pool of options is incredibly small to start.  The variety starts to come in too late and there frankly isn't enough of it. As others have said the PvE portion of most maps feels pointless and also kind of bad, despite also being the more fun part most matches.  Doing well in the PvE gives your team a head start on the PvP section that is rendered immediately useless if one team is simply better at pvp.  The respawn times are long and there's no real comeback mechanics in play. One team wipe is often all it takes. The PVP itself is... okay.   But there seems to be no real matchmaking.  Even in the very first game I played with friends we played against a guy in an exo that needed level 40 or $15 to unlock... who also had several level 5 mods installed.  We didn't even have mods unlocked. They made a noticeable difference.3 of the exos are locked behind a rather steep grind unless you want to pay another $15 on top of the $60 price tag as well. (The game is also on gamepass, but that's still no excuse).The story isn't bad but it's told in a really sporadic and piecemeal way that feels more interrupting than anything when trying to play with friends especially if they're not on the exact same step as you. There's no real progression outside of the mods.  The exos have 100% set weapons and abilities (except their secondary rig, which are a universal pool all mechs have access to) and it gets pretty stale pretty fast. The sad truth is the game just has no content at the start, trickles in a meager amount more as you sink more and more hours into it. It has greedy microtransactions designed to get you past a very tedious grind.  The cosmetics are full on skins and can't be used piece by piece.   What kind of mech game is so rigid in its customization?The game might get better. Their road map doesn't look bad. But I'm not rating a game on what it might become. I'm rating a game on what it is.And what it is, is a repetitive, shallow experience that's probably good for a few hours on gamepass with friends and then forgotten about until it gets a leviathan sized level of updates.",Negative

The story is interesting nothing super amazing but the gameplay itself is incredibly unique. If you want to just kill waves of enemies with friends and have cool iron man suits this is the perfect game. It has a lot of content but the mission repeatability is annoying sometimes you get same maps other times you get the super fun ones. I give it an 8 and it could have been a 9 if it had more maps which is a legitimate concern. I hope with the proper support which looks like they plan game can be very fun long term.,Positive

If you stick with it past the first ~3-4 hours to unlock better content there is a bit more here. Great:- This is a silly, wacky, fun game that is fun with friends or complete random! These games don't exist much anymore with a decent budget.- Core gameplay and feel are GREAT! Action feels amazing. Good:- Every class feels good to play, useful to your team, and don't have any overlapping skills.- Graphics are good and have a unique artstyle.- Game is well optimized, which is a rarity for new games today.- Everything happens quickly, matchmaking and load times are FAST, you get put right into the action with -minimal downtime.- Voice acting in English is fantastic and there are a good amount of funny moments from your main crew. Okay:- The story is little wacky and at times unserious which may put some off, but it is actually decently written.- There are a lot of cosmetics, this was clearly designed as a F2P game at some point. You can buy basic skins with in-game currency (there is only ONE kind of currency) that you actually get a lot of just from playing.- Loot boxes exist, but only function for you to get cosmetics. You get a lot from just playing. Bad:- No sense of progression: the beginning of the game is lacking in content and the game doesn't let you know there are more things to do if you just keep playing. But even endgame is lacking variety- Repetitive, for the first few hours you will be doing the exact same sequence in mission on the same 2-3 maps. You need to do 15 matches (15-20 minutes a pop) before you even unlock the next thing you can do.- There is no PVE-only mode. You are ALWAYS competing against a enemy team in real time, PVE just doesn't have Exosuit vs Exosuit combat, the enemy team can still invade as a boss dinosaur.- The PVP-mode doesn't have enough Exosuit vs Exosuit, it's really just the last 2 minutes of a match.- There are about 30 minutes of tutorials and cutscenes at the beginning of the game, which SUCKED. Terrible:- This is NOT worth $60, and I can totally see it becoming free-to-play.

Frankly no one can recommend this game and the only thing I can advise you is to stay away from this franchise that only wants your money and doesn't offer anything new or attractive.,Negative

If you're a die-hard Destiny fan, you'll probably still play or enjoy it, but if you're a more casual player, you might want to wait for a sale before picking it up. Our Full Review:https://www.theshchronicles.com/post/destiny-2-lightfall",Average
2172,destiny-2-lightfall,5-Apr-23,2,"- The story is unbelievable and childish (we encounter cybernetic humans who we see for the first time, not knowing if they even want to kill us at first sight or not, and immediately spill all our plans to them in the first sentence. and become best friends with them after a minute of talking)- The way that characters speak or joke is also pretty stupid and childish (the ghost or Nimbus in Neomuna)- The new location is pretty boring, just not exciting to play at all- The overall style of the game is inconsistent - there is a dark/gothic theme of the Hive, robotic race of the Vex, and then some characters look like in a cartoon (take a look at Shaw Han in the Cosmodrome when standing close to him)- Everything else in the game is the same as before, including the same season grind for the 20th time. Same running activities all over again just to get a nice-looking new armor and an ornament for the new exotic weapon (although we already have dozens of both armor and weapons, so another new one does not make a difference at all)- I wanted to see the group finder which was advertised for the expansion, but looks like it is only coming in the last season of the year, so together with social aspect being non-existent (zero chat going on anywhere), to assemble a group you have to actually go outside the game lol (website or mobile app)- It also looks like Bungie, the developer, does not even know what they want to do with their own game - they increased the health of enemies with the expansion, and then rolled it back after a month. So now it's back to being extremely boring where you just run through the activity killing all the enemies in one shot trying to complete daily missions (called bounties), and sometimes you shoot a rocket at them, but your teammates kill them faster than the time it takes your rocket to fly lol, so you have wasted a rocket and the ammo for it can be pretty scarce, which makes it all quite annoying So yeah, pretty bad. I wouldn't purchase or play if not for FOMO on the new armor and ornament for the exotic, so I will endure the mindless grind of the same boring activities (or give it up in the middle like already happened before)",Negative
2173,destiny-2-lightfall,20-Mar-23,5,"My review will be condensed into 3 sections. Story, gameplay, and endgame.Story: Destiny 2 Lightfall story felt more like a montage of learning a new power to use against the antagonist of the story. Though there were nice messages about learning, such as "" Flow with the current, not against it."" Was the only message that stuck with me. The story was ill comparison to the last expansion Witch Queen. Destiny 2 is currently in their 20th season, and is surprisingly a 6 year old game. Long time fans of the franchise already understand that Destiny story is convoluted, and usually buried in some lore cards usually known as grimore, but personally I just search up lore in YouTube channels such as MyNameIsByf. Lightfall story isn't delivered well, and left me with more questions than answers. After a few days of reading lore I can see the direction of the story, but this isnt acceptable way of delivering a story to an audience In video game. My biggest gripe of Lightfall is how poor the 2 new characters are. Their coverage felt very brief, and didn't really care much for them. Story definitely blended with the gameplay of strand, as the story revolved around the use of strand. Gameplay: Why change something , when you already good at something? Bungie can make a great fps game. Guns look great and feel great . You can feel how fine tuned this fps is compared to other games. This is their strong suit and surprisingly they can make it work for 31 years.The new super strand has to be used and no if or buts. Story is focused around learning Strand, so that's was the main focus ironically around a super. Bungie invested so much time in making strand and tuning their gameplay. I personally think they focused around gameplay this time around.The new super feels great and fun. Though this time around I felt the campaign still maintened a challenge, and see that player scaling is much better. Though I can see that over time the gameplay can get repetitive and  eventually feel boring over time.Endgame: Funny enough I expected the endgame activities to be difficult but boy I was wrong. Raid content is supposed to be the toughest challenge in the game and be the only content to prepare for. I don't know if it's an illusion of being to experienced at the game that is 6 years old. Perhaps this is the view of long time fans of the franchise. The new raid  in my experience was very easy as there aren't many mechanics involved. I could talk about Bungies raid structure for hours. The Root of Nightmares Raid is a great raid for new players of the game. Not so much for veterans since it isn't as challenging, but I understand what Bungie was doing to get more players to do this raid. My only gripe was that every encounter except the 3rd Planets encounter was the same. Heck the last raid boss is basically first encounter with a boss. The only endgame activities I found difficult are the exotic mission in Legendary mode and Legend-higher nightfall activies. Difficulty of raids usually come from the different roles players are responsible for. Since 2 people are required to do mechanics in the new raid people can 3 man a 6 player activity. Usually Bungie has 5-6 players split in doing at most 3 roles. Perhaps this is what the community asked for based on the last non-reprisal raid Vow of The Disciple. Since there are call outs of symbols that can have different interpretations, making the raid difficult. After this expansion i believe Bungie aimed to cater to not just veterans but to newcomers, and returning players of the franchise.",Average

2175,destiny-2-lightfall,16-Mar-23,6,"Pretty decent DLC, its definitely better than Beyond Light and Shadowkeep. But the narrative is strange and unclear (Rohan and Nimbus are so stereotypical) . The new raid is awesome! Its easy, fast a picturesque.",Average
2176,destiny-2-lightfall,13-Mar-23,4,"Wanted to wait to review until the raid was out, so here we are. First of all, people need to stop with these dumb 0/10 ratings. Lightfall is not a 0. It's bad, but these ratings are all just spiteful, not fair. Lightfall starts off pretty good, with a nice cutscene, some intrigue and shock value, but once the actual gameplay starts, the quality drops instantly. They introduce this new civilization, but they don't flesh it out. We see 2 characters throughout the campaign, one of which is the cringiest character I think I've ever seen in Destiny and that's it. We're supposed to care about saving them and Neomuna but they don't give us a reason to. It's all just go here, stop this, kill that and it's getting tiresome. They asked 50 bucks for a campaign you can finish in 4 hours, with a barebones filler story. D2's biggest issue is its storytelling. Look at Halo 2. It was made by the same studio, yet the quality of storytelling is not even comparable. There is no character development and they conclude most things in repetitive seasonal stories. The formula they use is flawed and needs changing. As for the raid, it is visually pleasing and has OP weapons. That's about it. The mechanics are boring and overall, the raid is way too easy. I'd argue that even Vault of Glass is more difficult than this. Now, some positives are Strand. It's a fun new subclass that I can see replacing Stasis for crowd control, and it's great for movement. The Exotics and Neomuna as a location are also good. There's quite a bit to grind for and the gameplay is solid as always, but the positives don't outweigh the negatives unfortunately. This entire expansion feels like it was cut in half. I'm convinced this was all supposed to be part of The Final Shape, but they just decided to split it in two so they can milk some more money from people. Overall very disappointing and I would not recommend buying it at full price. It's barely worth 30 bucks. I suggest waiting for a sale or buying from the known third party sellers",Negative
2177,destiny-2-lightfall,13-Mar-23,6,"This DLC is not as good as the Witch Queen, and I was expecting more from ""the beginning of the end"" of the light and dark saga in Destiny. The Story and narrative are a big let down, and even after all the side quests done, you're left with a huge amount of questions. But the gameplay is really good, strand is really fun and feel well balances with all of the other subclasses (not like stasis at launch). The overall content of the DLC including Raid, Events, Weapons and exotics is pretty good, even if Neomuna feels a bit empty. Get this DLC if you are a regular Destiny player, you cannot be disapointed, but if you're only interrested in the story, wait for the Final Shape, or at least for some seasons to come out.",Average
2178,destiny-2-lightfall,11-Mar-23,3,"I've stopped playing completely and have lost all interest in Destiny 2. I decided to give Bungie a chance with Witch Queen only for Bungie to take whatever good faith they had built up with WQ (and the following MEH seasons) and throw it right back in the trash. The grind isn't fun anymore, the story and writing was awful, the weapons are reskins, the raid is underwhelming, a large swath of cosmetics are locked behind the Eververse, and I'm sick of grinding out battlepasses for stuff that should have been in the game naturally. I feel like Bungie just wants me to keep dumping buckets of cash at them because of some made up of customer loyalty they think they've earned at this point and I'm sick of it. I've loved the series and the franchise since the alpha on PS4 but I don't think I can or will keep supporting this game or the Destiny series.

BUT - the Witch Queen had feeling, lore, story, interaction, meaning behind what you were doing, and intertwined what we knew and made it better.  Lightfall is just an update, not an expansion.  It feels like seasonal content wrapped into a bow and you now have to wait for a year to get conclusions...  That's not worth $100 imo.

Bungie pulled the wool over everyone's eyes with this one and delivered such a slap in the face to the fanbase. The writing is undefendable and the new area is small and has zero detail. It looks like an N64 world but with HD textures. And not to mention there are literally only two inhabitants on the entire planet that you can see. The streets and buildings are all empty (and Bungie's poor excuse to explain why its empty does not make this emptiness alright and if anything it is insulting to the player audience).

Unit variety and tactics may not be as in-depth as in other strategy games. Certain building methods, like ramps on your walls, aren't possible. Thoughts-While it doesn’t quite have Minecraft’s DIY toolset to build just about anything or the extensive research trees and approaches of real time strategy games, Minecraft Legends is a successful fusion of both genres into something wholly unique. It’s relatively easy to pick up and play while offering a healthy amount of depth and some fun battles that grow more challenging as you progress.

It's annoying that the Player can only help in clearing small enemies. It would be nice if the player could use an auto-guided bow (shoot at a tenacious target, for example), or other weapons with which to support the breakdown of buildings (it's not always nice to wait when your army breaks the portal, and you wait for a few minutes)The intelligence of the companions makes much to be desired, making a siege on the Horde of Disputes, I notice several times how my army just falls off the ramp, and most of the passages stand at the precipice from the stairs (especially at the Bastion)I wrote all this while going through only the Campaign, not multiplayer, not paid contentPlot: 5/10 (it's like it's made for show)Gameplay: 6/10 (plus 1 personal score)World: 7/10Mechanics: 5/10Graphics: 8/10As a result: 31/50Not bad, I would like changes",Average

2251,forspoken,29-Jul-23,3,"This is atrocious.   Absolutely atrocious.  For one, the game's actual performance is shockingly bad, we're talking about a game that looks awful even compared to stuff that's come out in the past several years, and cannot maintain a consistent framerate even with Ray-tracing off, its that bad.  I mean even Control from 2019 runs and looks better than Flop-spoken.  Secondly, the actual start of the game is seriously ten cutscenes, a 3 second run through a hallway, then another 10 seconds of running down a city street where male NPC's react to you but NPC women inexplicably don't probably because they forgot to animate it or work it into collision detection when you brushed up against certain non-interactable surfaces or something.  Then our heroine escapes into her apartment, where we get another cutscene.  I mean is this what developers think modern games are supposed to be now?  How odd, because I always heard first impressions matter. The first actual bits of gameplay in Forspoken is looking at three photos, which is not skippable for some reason, even though its just a cutscene that forces you to look at the photos- for no reason when this could be accomplished.. in a cutscene.  Actual movement in this game is bizarrely animated, and cumbersome.  I have no idea how to describe it.  Its like a skeleton on roller-skates, and Mrs. Forspoken plows into everything as if she needs to climb it or vault over it or jump off of it, because apparently this is what developers think constitutes parkour elements, when they were done better in games like Mirrors Edge over 14 YEARS AGO.  If anything this game is a strong argument that western development teams are getting less talented and more dumb every year. Beyond all of these initial unbelievably terrible choices I can't imagine playing it.  Like for more than 10 minutes, which I didn't bother to.  I wasn't about to sit through skipping cinematics to get to three minutes of gameplay that isn't interesting in the slightest.  Its not a surprise that the studio basically was shuddered after this failed to produce results, but then again SquareEnix as a publisher has been making some shockingly bad decisions as well as unwise investments in terms of development teams and this should be a wake-up call for them.  Forspoken is so awful that it shouldn't be played.  No attention should ever be given to it unless its to point out complete and utter failures in this decade so far.  Pretty wild that even the PC port with modding potentional, if anyone even cared to invest in modding potential that is, still couldn't ever hope to fix this title. As a final note, numerous channels have covered the abhorrent dialogue, writing, and just disgusting facial animations that plague what could've at least been a well presented story, even if the gameplay was mediocre.  This is that whole argument that videogame journalists like to use when it comes to garbage like Forspoken, and they would've defended it had the story been worth preserving in some way, but its hopeless trash that could barely be considered fan-fiction in terms of quality.  The dialogue is so bad, so obtuse, the narrative so bland, so lifeless, that I would rather pay a 6 year old kid to play the game, and then recall the story to me with finger puppets from memory.  At least then, I might get some entertainment out of it.  Lines like, ""you are hereby charged with the crime of Tanta-cide,"" or the fact that the main villains name is Susurrus, a word not used in the english language since 1824 and definitely not known to the writer when he was conceptualizing this turd of a game- are just the tip of iceberg when it comes to how bafflingly bad everything is. Something like Forspoken should be put in a vault, like a great evil or cursed object so our parents can tell us stories about how it almost crashed the videogame market or something 80 years from now.  It has to be seen to be believed to be quite honest, but I wouldn't recommend getting too close something this bad for your health.",Negative

2255,forspoken,28-Jun-23,6,"Overall i felt the game wasn't bad. Decent graphics, but felt it wasn't as smooth as a AAA game should be. Storyline was interesting. Typical fish out of water story. But would have preferred a more linear approach as opposed to an overly large open world game. Could have used more varied enemies and a better variety of side quests that are more fleshed out. As far as the main character goes, I didn't mind her. Voice acting was good. Banter between her and Cuff was occasionally funny. It feels weird that people complain about her swearing. I was fine with that. Here's my problem. Her character arc took way too long for her to turn around. By the 50% mark she should have flipped from angry and flippant to a bit more likeable and invested in what was going on around her. This would have showed more consistent growth. Waiting until almost the end for her to 'come around' wasn't a great decision. It's okay to make a protagonist unlikable. I find it refreshing, but you have to show positive character growth throughout instead of doing a 180 at the end of the story or it comes off as unrealistic. A good example of how it should be done is in the recent series Wednesday. Started off unlikable, but by the halfway point you really enjoy the protagonist, and at the end the character growth felt satisfying. Regardless, Forspoken doesn't deserve the review bombing. It was fun. I enjoyed playing it, but felt the three main weaknesses were: repetitive quests, open world worked against the story, and character growth took far too long.",Average

Sadly, that was precisely the experience I had when I played Forspoken, a game that was supposed to be a thrilling adventure but turned out to be an exercise in political correctness and social justice. One of the biggest issues with the game was its content, which was chock-full of social justice and political correctness that had no place in the gameplay. While it's essential to have representation and inclusivity in games, it's another matter entirely when the storyline and mechanics are overshadowed by these issues. Unfortunately, that's precisely what happened with Forspoken, where the political messages felt forced, preachy, and often completely irrelevant to the gameplay. The game's storyline was also disappointing, as it seemed more interested in pushing its political agenda than providing an exciting, immersive experience. The characters were shallow and one-dimensional, with their entire existence seemingly defined by their gender, ethnicity, or sexuality. It was as if the game was trying to tick off a checklist of diversity rather than focusing on creating a compelling story with memorable characters. Even worse, the gameplay itself suffered from the game's political agenda. The mechanics were often clunky, and the controls were frustratingly difficult to master, making the game almost unplayable. It felt like the developers had focused so much on pushing their message that they forgot that the game itself needed to be enjoyable to play. Overall, Forspoeken was a massive disappointment, with its heavy-handed political messages and irrelevant social justice content detracting from what could have been a genuinely exciting gaming experience. While representation and inclusivity are essential, they should never come at the expense of gameplay or story.

Die Grafik ist in der riesigen Open World von größeren Konstrukten (Hauptstadt ausgenommen) verloren gegangen oder noch nicht vorhanden, aber das überwiegt das schnelle und vor allem fantastische Gameplay aber mehr als genug. Man hat für alle 4 Elemente/Skill-Tree´s 3 Angriffszauber, die entweder halb-automatisch oder vollautomatisch eingesetzt werden können, die meisten davon können auch 3 Stufen lang aufgeladen werden und nochmal einen extra starken Schuss abgeben. Dann gibt es ca. 10 Unterstützungsmagien, die Target-Zauber, AOE, Heal, Buff oder Defense-Zauber sind.Jede Elementmagie hat nochmal eine Schubmagie, welche eine extrem starke Magie, die über Einsatz von Unterstützungs- und Angriffsmagie aufgeladen wird. Diese hat ebenfalls drei aufladbare Stufen und haut ordentlich rein. Die Story ist am Anfang sehr präsent, ungefähr zum Verlassen der Hauptstadt. Dann ist man erstmal auf die Open World losgelassen und ich für meinen Teil fand das völlig in Ordnung, ich wollte erstmal erkunden, alle Open World Aktivitäten kennenlernen und dann erstmal alles weiter auf dem Weg bis zum Questgebiet abarbeiten. In der Mainquest kommt man später auf Grund der vielen Zauber teilweise auch gar nicht, dafür bekommt man eine sehr schöne Story vorgesetzt. Danach hat man mehr Fähigkeiten, die man erstmal alle vollumfänglich ausprobieren möchte und dafür ist die große Open World perfekt, in die man sich dann stürzen kann, um alles auszuprobieren und auch sonst macht es einfach Spaß in riesen Gegnermenge reinzurennen und alles einzusetzen was man hat, mir hat das gesamte Spiel (mit Abstand sehr vielen anderen Spielen) sehr gefallen!",Positive

However, upon playing the game, it became clear that while the game featured a vast map and decent graphics, the story and gameplay fell short of many of my expectations. The world-building and rewards for exploration were underwhelming, the story was dull and cringe-worthy, the MC and dialogue was horrendous, and the traversal and combat mechanics, even if fairly fun, were clunky and jarring. Here's my breakdown: Graphics- 4/10 - The graphics in this game are a mixed bag of beauty and disappointment. While the combat, animals, enemies, foliage, hair, clothes, magic, and most environments are breathtakingly gorgeous, the water looks stale and outdated, like it belongs in an unmodded 2011 Skyrim. The models and textures for human faces are decent, but the clunky and lifeless facial animations detract from the overall experience. The skybox also feels flat and unrealistic, even when all the settings are set to Ultra, and fails to inspire any sense of awe or beauty. The landscape, while still beautiful, is marred by poor quality sky and water. The NPCs in this game are generally dull and bland looking, with the exception of Frey and a few actors that were clearly 3D scanned. Clothing designs seem to have been given more attention than NPC faces and animations. Interestingly, the children in Athia are an exception to this trend, with their faces and facial animations being of a much higher quality than the adult NPCs, which compared to other titles is surprising, out of all the NPCs in this game it seems the children, Frey, enemies, and animals are the most well done. The combat, magic, and other areas of the game are visually stunning, but ultimately fall short of a cohesive Next Gen appeal that the marketing materials implied. Worldbuilding - 9/10 - The map is pretty big, I'd wager to say it's about on par with HZD in size; there's plenty of notes and books and things to read and learn to deepen your understanding of the world and it's lore. Not much to say here, the world building felt pretty solid, the only thing that knocked a point off for me was the cringey and unrealistic commentary that starkly contrasted with the tone in the menus. Traversal - 4/10 - The game's movement mechanics are pretty fun, but alas, the parkour abilities are unfortunately hampered by invisible walls and other restrictive elements in cities. Understandably, the game disables magical traversal in certain cities, but it left me feeling cheated as I had hoped to jump and explore on rooftop using parkour throughout the game, which seemed implied by the game earlier on. Furthermore, certain areas and parts of the story force you to walk at a slow pace or prevent climbing, running, and exploring, whether due to poor collisions or simply being restricted by design, which is irksome. In summary, the traversal can be fun but is ultimately hindered by limitations in exploration and unresponsive parkour. Combat - 3/10 - The combat in the game is fairly fun to an extent, with a large skill tree to upgrade abilities, but many skills do not feel organically earned, just ""you earned enough XP and here you go, you can unlock this now"". Mixing of combat seems clunky and unintuitive, making it hard to stream combos and apply style with parkour system. The game also forces you to switch abilities on the fly with cool-down periods and slow recovery times. Dodging is fun, but seems to be introduced at the wrong point in the story, making it feel inorganic. The magic abilities are gorgeous but not well set up for chain combos, relying more on spamming and taking you out of the action with slowed menu switching. Overall, it feels like Square Enix was trying to mix Witcher 3, PS4 Spider-man, Dark Souls, and Horizon Zero Dawn combat systems, but fails to implement them in a cohesive way, leaving you with a decently fun but not overly enjoyable combat system. Story - 1/10 - The story in this game is an utter failure, with cringey dialogue, nonsensical character traits, an overly mean and un-relatable main character, missed story beats, mis-paced, and overall destruction of the suspension of disbelief. The Isekai plot points are non-existent beyond the very basic ""transported to a new world and now have superpowers"", and seems devoid of making friends or any romantic interest. The plot is predictable and shallow, as if it was written by a 6th grader. Unfunny, cringey, forgettable and boring, it put me to sleep twice so far and I am left wondering if I'll even be able to finish the game. Overall Score - 1/10 - fun to play overall, but the story and other negative points make this game very boring, un-intuitive and nauseatingly cringey.",Negative

Начну с того, что бросается в глаза с первого взгляда: с графики. Она не просто плохая, она действительно ужасная. Это уровень игр 2014-15 годов, но никак не 2023 года. И ладно бы при такой графике она требовала бы столько же, сколько и они. Но нет, эту убогую игру еле вытягивают карты 40-ой серии... В некоторых областях фпс падает просто катастрофически.

Сам сюжет до ужаса вторичный, а наратив просто смешон: вместо катсцен с диалогами, операторской съемкой и так далее — статичные стеклянные статуи людей, которые обмениваются звуковой информацией (речью я это назвать не могу), а игроку предлагают слушать всю эту тягомотину по несколько минут и так 15+ раз за игры. Мммм, класс (нет)Может быть весь этот ужас перевесит интересный геймплей?)

Indeed, despite a beautiful world, I ended the game without exploring maybe 70% of the world and the reason for that lays in the lack of variety in the main quest to make us explore the world (it's mostly just go to the boss and we can do stuff on the way) and the lack of side quest. The side quest are non existent, just being useless objectives in the only city of the game. Forspoken would have been a 10/10 for me just by pushing us to explore more with real side quest and more diverse main quest.

This game also has a huge lack of polish, if its the performance or the glitches the game is just a mess. Lastly the gameplay which is mediocre most of it is boring like tailing missions and side quests in the mediocre open world but the combat is pretty good and fun, but still the open world gives you no insentive to play since the world is completely shallow.

I'm a conservative. I hate the woke as much as anyone else. At first I listened to all the reviews on here saying the game was a woke dumpster fire. Nothing could be further from the truth. The game isn't woke at all. In fact it often makes fun of the main protagonist in subtle ways.

The dialogue is the main highlight and seems to represent the nadir/lowest point of video games. Just even hard to imagine how the developers and the team of ""all-star"" writers could think that this game could be successful by any means. But this review is only for the developers and the writers and not the actor who voiced  Frey. Instead, I would like to commend Ella Balinska (the voice actor) for keeping up with and voicing the extremely unlikable and unsympathetic dialogue crafted by the developers and the team of ""all-star"" writers. Forspoken is a masterclass in how not to make video games. The developers should take lessons from A Plague Tale series, Red Dead Redemption series, God of War (2018 and Ragnarok), The Last of Us series, Halo series, and indie titles (Hollow Knight, Ori, Tunic, Stray, etc.) on constructing impactful video games.",Negative
2367,forspoken,27-Jan-23,9,"Really liking the game so far! Played the DEMO on PS5 so I knew what I was getting into. PROS:-Incredible loading times. Less than a second waiting after clicking „Continue“ from main menu. Appears to use DirectStorage 1.1 from .dll inspection.-Can save pretty much anywhere (no special save points or something like that).-Very fun gameplay and traversal. The combos you can do with magic are really cool. P.S. there is a way to instantly charge LV3 magic - really satisfying once you learn that.-No #StutterStruggle. If it stutters for you then I suggest check your VRAM usage. Also enabling Dynamic Resolution option causes strange stuttering for me at least. I suggest use DLSS - looks better and does not stutter.-Awesome HDR implementation. OLED TV users are in for a treat (HDR highlights really look insane on S95B OLED).-Good enough PC graphics settings (DLSS2 and FSR2 support, Ultrawide etc..)-Feels very good on K&M. Way better mouse support than FFXV (That game runs on the same engine). Menus work natively with mouse. CONS:-A lot of dialoge can appear too cringy for a lot of people it seems. I kinda like it tho. But I guess I am used to that type of dialogue in different JRPGs. Edit: after playing more the dialogue is really fine and makes sense to me. Also, Ella Balinska doing some fine VO work, good job!-GPU reqirements are really high. The demo area is not as demanding as some of the areas in the full game. I'm talking like 70-80fps in one area (the demo area to be precise) and ~55fps in another area. Both areas are tested in a non combat scenario. In combat it drops even more.-Graphics appear to be downgraded from very first 2020 trailers. Now it does look Next Gen in some scenes (Mostly in combat) while in other scenes reminds me of PS3 style lighting (Towns and some cutscenes or some non important NPC animations).-Not really that visible RT implementation (RTGI or RT Reflections would be really great additions)-Slow beggining chapters may put off some people (And a lot of janky animation work at the beggining). Tho I urge everyone to keep playing, it gets a lot better.-Quite high storage requirement. 121 GB on my SSD. Would love to give a higher rating to the game, but that lighting in most areas is pretty lame. Really strange to see a PS5/PC only game without dynamic time of day and that off putting lighting. Also I recommend playing on powerful PC, because as the time of writing 2023-01-27 the PS5 version runs really poorly. Review PC specs:CPU: i7-13700KFGPU: RTX 4080RAM: 32GB DDR5 5600MHZ CL36STORAGE: SAMSUNG 980 PRO (Heatsink version) Games runs at a mostly locked 60 FPS in 3840x2160 with maxed out settings and DLSS Balanced on this system. (DLSS Quality also works well, but has minor drops here and there). Edit: apparently in some more demangind areas I need to set DLSS to performance to prevent noticable drops. I do not think those areas are that much more striking visually to have such a pefromance cost tho. Maybe sometime a patch will make those areas run better.",Positive

Yeah, that. Fun.), the writing is interminably bad with an extremely irritating protagonist. The world building seemed encouraging enough, Athia wasn't terrible (as a world; the x-ray vision and stupid 'open world' tropes of collecting for the sake of collecting is paint-by-numbers dull), but not enough to pull anyone in because of the obvious other flaws. Because yeah, the real killer was the non-stop fade to black for cut scenes, every 10 seconds, over and over and over and over again. Unplayable. Had to refund as can't reward this game design - it's padding, nothing less than pointless padding. Also, it's unoptimised to a funny degree.

Reminds me of a higher budget version of The Quiet Man game, crossed with the melodramatic exposition of a real-life modern person comparable to Life Is Strange.The game is slow and lumbering in every aspect: character movement, action sequences, transition from scene to scene. Constant fades to black and silent moments, the already slow pace of the story is further artificially slowed down ad-nauseum. The dialogue is very wooden, cliched and cringey, with awkward pauses between each line. The main character's performance is constantly over-acted and over-performed, over-expressed. Nothing here makes sense. Several dialogue/writing continuity errors. Plot hole every 10 minutes.Somewhat empty and lifeless world to explore.The main character often does things which make her unlikable, it's hard to immerse.Technically it's also badly coded/optimised, a sad reminder that modern developers and coders are using bloated, leaky untidy code. The game looks like it could've come out 8-10 years ago, but it plays like it needs a computer from the future. Overall, the game feels more like the product of board meetings and market research, with no heart or soul. The saving grace is the voice acting for Cuff, and some interesting environments, and some cool creatures/bosses.",Negative

Персонажи говны.Главная героиня по всем канонам нынешней повестки нигерша, к тому же ""особенная"". Абсолютно все персонажи крайне бесят в своей тупости, лицемерии и убогости. За пример идти вообще не буду. 3 или 4 шлюхи поссорились и призвали демона. Они его победили, но не победили. Этот самый демон стал браслетами и прикрепился к каждой из этих сук, начав сводить их с ума. Как думаете, эти самые шлюхи, которые являются по совместительству правителями своих земель сделали хоть что то, чтоб уберечь своих подданных? Они их предупредили о том, что сойдут с ума? Нет! Нихуя подобного! В игре же из уст ГГ прозвучало примерно следующее ""Они являлись просто жертвами, а виноват демон"", при том, что именно они его и призвали!2. Логика говны.Тут все просто. Эти браслеты, являющиеся фактически частями демона сводили обладателей с ума. Это правило разрабы сами же и нарушили, показав гг во время сцены после титров, которая спокойно себе живёт с таким браслетом и даже с ним разговаривает. Так же логика вышла из чата потому, что у гг мать и отец белые, но при этом сама ""героиня"" является нигершой. Мать вместо того, чтоб отдать свою дочь отцу, просто выкидывает её в портал. В рандомное место и рандомное время. Попав в детский дом ещё младенцем гг получила имя. Замечу, что она могла получить абсолютно любое, хоть жопа залупина, но при этом эта сука выдает следующее ""так мать меня назвала в ее/его честь"", или что то в этом духе. И так со всем!3. Оптимизация и графика говны.Даже на 4090 ФПС порой падал до 57 кадров + фризы и другого рода говно. Эти партикли вообще бесполезны, хоть они так ими коечились. Можно было сделать куда красивее и менее ресурсозатратно. Графика хуже, чем в атсасине юнити, но это уже мем.4. Сюжет говны.Как и заведено в деловых дерьмоиграх/дерьмоаниме у нас тут гребаный исекай. Бомжиха бросила своего кота и исекайнулась в какой то фентезийный мир. Ее сразу все начали облизывать, мол какая она особенная и необычная, и так далее и так далее. По факту что мы имеем?1) Сплошные плоские клише про избранную/особенную/единственную и неповторимую.2) 12 глава просто зашквар. Все, из чего она состоит, так это из ""слезовыжималок"" и убогой экспозиции, чтоб отбелить боссов игры, мол ""они лишь жертвы, в во всем демон виноват. Такие они хорошие"" и не учитывая того, что именно эти бабы виноваты в смерти их мира.P.S. Эта игра идеально показывает то, что женщины у власти приведут цивилизацию в упадок, если не к полной аннигиляции, после чего перекинут всю вину на кого либо, лишь бы самим не отвечать за свои действия.

2421,forspoken,25-Jan-23,0,"Unfortunately, Metacritic does not have a page for the PC Demo unlike for the PS5 which it does, so I will leave my review of the demo here I was excited for the game when it was announced in 2020 and was actually thinking about buying it, however as time progressed and we got to see much more gameplay footage I came to realize that the game was becoming barebones as time goes on and this was verified when I played the demo released on Steam. Starting with the performance issues it is abysmal, there is no reason for this game to suck up 10 - 12GB of VRAM during gameplay and for some reason, there are these huge random pauses for 3-4 seconds. It is way worse than your individual stutters that were prevalent in the recent releases of The Callisto Protocol. Keep in mind I am running this game on an RTX 4090 paired with a 5950X at 1440p. I locked the FPS to 60 just to see if that would mitigate it and still no hope. Clearly, the devs have skimped on optimization. This is even confirmed when the recommended GPU is an RTX 3070 which is a high mid-range GPU. Moving onto gameplay, at best it's meh. It's nothing special or actually interesting while the game does give you the ability to switch between some sort of sword and range attack magic it just feels bland and boring. This isn't supported by the fact that the world is so desolate and empty with the occasional enemy NPCs here and there, I feel like Square Enix designed the world first and just sprinkled enemies randomly toward the end when they felt like they were rushing to meet the deadline. I won't speak for the story as this was just the demo, but I will finally point out that the bracelet thing is extremely annoying. Overall don't pick this game up right now, especially given the price point is $70 (US) feels like an absolute scam. Wait for a year or so for the bugs to be ironed out and sales to kick in. I feel like the game would probably be a decent buy for $25 ish but even that's asking for a lot",Negative

So, the truth is certainly more complicated than that and lies internally at Sqex whose ambitions and marketing have seen themselves radically turn towards NFTs... (what a good idea!)

Skills restricted to mastering different weapons, which must also be crafted. Dull protagonist, and constant pacing breaks. Numerous bugs, especially for enemies, combined with a distinct lack of polish. Enemy variety feels limited. Thoughts-Stray Blade is a game that could have been something more. With additional polish, it could at least be more fun to play, ensuring smoother exploration and less problematic enemies.

The combat system was clunky and unsatisfying, with little variation in moves or strategies.Furthermore, the variety of enemies felt limited and repetitive, with little distinction between them beyond cosmetic differences. And finally, the story was unengaging and failed to captivate my attention, with underdeveloped characters and a lack of compelling plot points.Overall, while I can appreciate the effort that went into creating the game, I cannot recommend it due to these significant issues that hinder the gameplay experience.

2458,stray-blade,21-Apr-23,8,"Stray Blade is an adventure game with souls-like elements. But that description doesnt describe the way the game is. I will go into a few of the main aspects of the game and give the good and the ugly about it. Combat:-The game has a parry, a dodge and with certain weapons a block. Perfect parries stagger an enemy for a second, deal poise damage and give back stamina. Parrying at just the wrong time blocks the damage, but doesnt stagger the enemy and leaves you open to a second attack. Just like parrying, perfect dodging recovers you some stamina but doesnt stagger enemies. And blocking is well... blocking.-The combat can feel clunky at times due to its unforgiving damage and stagger when you dont perfect dodge or parry and the stamina economy also requires you to do perfect parries and dodges. Some weapons have slow attack combos and dont have enough hyper armor, nor can you increase your poise like in a Fromsoft game. It takes some getting used to but eventually the flow of combat will become more of a dance then a battle. If you can find the patience for it that is.-The abilities you unlock troughout the game (Intium, Manninite and Xhinnon) have their own uses in combat, Intium is fun, Manninite seems fun but doesnt do enough to make it worth it and Xhinnon turns on easy-mode. Story:-The story is pretty good if you read all the extra lorestones you can find around the game and talk to Boji whenever you can. Without the lorestones and Boji the story does become confusing, and the ending becomes very confusing and a bit weird.-The valley of Acrea is very rich in its culture and history, and you can find out quite a bit about how the society was before their fall. Many areas have interesting tid bits of lore regarding them. The valley also looks very pretty. Exploration:-The exploration is this game is quite fun and reminds me of metroidvanias. You go trough an area, see some stuff you dont have the ability to get and come back later to find some nice customizations or other secrets.-The world as noted before looks great and each new area is great to look at and run around in. Performance:-I ran the game on high settings on a 3070, Intel I-7 10700k with 16GB ram. I only noticed minor performance issues in certain areas. (Have to go back and check the areas again to give acurate and recent statistics on this since my info on this is outdated) Final Thoughts:Stray Blade is a good game that I am going to be replaying a handful of times with some fun challenges for myself. There are aspects that could be better or design choices that couldve been made differently but looking at the game as a whole its 100% been a blast and I cant wait to see what the future brings to this game.",Positive
2459,the-last-of-us-part-i,5-Aug-23,6,"I liked the story, the beautiful world with attention to detail, the designers really put effort into it. Enhanced by pleasant music and nice ambient sounds. I'm not a fan of stealth, and it's a shame that due to the lack of ammo, a more direct approach wasn't possible, but I understand it's for the sake of the story. Over time, it started to bother me to search through empty rooms just to find 2 bullets. I actually grew fond of Joel, but Ellie was too foul-mouthed for my taste. (If 14-year-olds behave like that in the USA, then God help them.) I'm not sure if I missed some bestiary, but I would have liked more explanation about the mutants. Even considering the state of the world, I missed at least one positive character. The technical state was dreadful. First, it took over an hour to compile shaders.

The graphics are amazing and detailed, the characters and dialogue and story are intriguing, but it all keeps getting interrupted by a completely run-of-the-mill cover shooter with some stealth elements. There is only 1 part in the game I would even consider a boss fight, and it's nowhere near the end of the game.

2465,the-last-of-us-part-i,15-Jul-23,8,"8.5/10. First of all, I played in patch 1.10, and now it seems ok, I didn't see any major bug and my performance was ok on a RX 580, not great, not bad. The Last of Us is a linear game similar to Uncharted but the difference is here we are way more focused on stealth and survival aspects. Story 8.5/10 - The game setting is an apocalyptic pandemic world where a fungus pretty much transforms people into zombies that infect people by biting them. 60% of the world's population died because of that and the rest becomes assh0l3s to survive, it is like a free for all in an abandoned world. I like how the places we get through develop this world, we have many records telling what happened with the world, the letters of ""survivors"" and the places we go really show a true post-apocalyptic world with hundreds of broken empty buildings, hundreds of cars broken down and rusted, also there are many sprayed graffiti sayings things in houses front like: ""stay away, I have a weapon and I'm gonna shot you"". Now, the main story, we follow Joel, a smuggler that lost his daughter when the pandemic apocalyptic began. He works with his partner Tess. They receive work from the Fireflights, a militia group, to smuggle a girl, Ellie, that is immune to the virus. At first, Joel tries not to be attached to the girl, he even wants to give this job up, but his partner, Tess insists, then she is bitten by an infected and begs for him to go on with the job, saying that Ellie is the only hope for this sh1tty world. Throughout the journey, they are attacked many times and meet different people. I think each of them develops something, Bill (a crazy dude that lives all alone in an abandoned district) tells Joel that is better to give up and that he is gonna die if he tries to protect other people, interestingly, Bills survives. Then we meet Henry and his younger brother Sam (that looks like his son honestly), Sam is infected and Henry suicide, IMO they show how cruel this disease is and there is no hope for those infected. We meet Joel's brother that extended his hand to give them shelter, so they have an option, but they refused, following their idealistic thoughts instead. Ellie is kidnaped by cannibals and one of them, David wanna forgave her if she abandons Joel, but she refused and fight like hell against them. I think that encounter showed the loyalty of Ellie and her furious personality. In the end, after so many hardships Joel managed to deliver the girl to the Fireflights but when arrived there, they told him she needs to die to bring the cure for mankind but Joel refuses, slaughtering everyone in his way, and rescuing the girl, the girl that in the beginning he said he didn't care. Interestingly it seems everything was for nothing and that is discussed before. But although the whole journey for both characters was for nothing, which is kinda disappointing, it showed very well how this disturbed world works. Combat 9/10 - Honestly, I am kinda saturated of with these third-person shooters but here, I must admit the system in this game is very good, maybe the best I've played. I like how in this game the human enemies don't have any radar, so if they see you but you flee they lose sight of you. Also, you can pick up a bottle of brick and throw it into the enemies to stun them or in the ground to make noise, it is a very good system. The weapon's ammunition is limited and you can craft bombs, medkits and improvements to your melee weapon. Although I liked the combat against enemies' humans, I think sometimes it is kinda repetitive and it is just there to increase the gameplay time. But for me what definitely takes the cake is the combat against the infected. They are very fun to fight against because they are so different from other type of enemies. There are many types of these infected but the most interesting aspect is that they are blind and they locate you by the sound (and some with echo-location), so if you don't make noise you can pass through them, or you can throw a brick in the ground and everyone will group up to that sound. Also, there are dark parts where the clickers make a sound so creepy, it seems like in a horror movie. Gameplay 7/10 - when we not doing all of those things above, we are resolving some puzzles and collecting resources. I thank Naughty Dog for not doing such a bad puzzle-like in Uncharted 4. Here, the puzzles are ok. Overall, 8.5/10. Great game.",Positive

It only gets a 3 because I played through some of the content. I leave first impressions below:I finally got to play the Remake of The Last of Us on PC to see the Juicy Graphics and enhanced gameplay. I played The Last of Us on the PS3, the Remastered on PS4, and now we are at the Remake.I have to say, this is the worst Port to PC I have ever seen, the game stutters for me a lot, I am yet to see any crashes, and the shader compilation took over 2 hours?! My specs:- Ryzen 5 3600- 16GB DDR4- HDD- RTX 3060 12GI tested the game @ 1440p and 1080p with DLSS on all quality modes, on High Graphics, it runs at 60fps+ but can't maintain a constant locked Framerate, and stutters a lot, especially during combat sections. As for the price, there is no reason for this game to be full price, if you're going to buy this, DON'T. Wait 6 months, and make sure your PC is beefed up. I'd pay around $30 for a game that was already released 10 years ago with fancy graphics, and no multiplayer. The enhancements of this game are pretty poor for a ""REMAKE"", Joel may be old but give the man a dodge mechanic. I expected that to be added because damn it's pretty tough to play after being exposed to Part 2s mechanics. Yes, yes crafting table, whatever, it's just a flashy weapon upgrade screen. Clearly, Sony, Naughty Dog and Iron Galaxy did not test this game properly or at all and decided to take shortcuts. I love Playstation games, but this port hurts a lot, especially towards PC players. I want more Ports from Sony but if they are going to be like this, I don't want them, I'd rather not waste my time and not support them. It's a 6/10, Somewhat playable, but with bad stuttering at least for me, no multiplayer, and no actual or useful enhancements. A 6/10 in my book means you don't need to get this immediately, Just wait for a Sale on Steam. How the Mighty, have fallen. Personal Message to PlayStation (If an employee ever reads this): You guys make good games, I've been a fan for more than 15 years but from what I've seen recently you have forgotten that quality is better than quantity. While yes you have delivered good ports of other games so far, The Last of Us is one of your biggest properties and should have been polished from day one. One day I hope to work for PlayStation but if this is going to be the direction you'll be taking, shortcuts, following trends and making poor decisions, I would say I'm better off at EA or Ubisoft. Good luck and Happy Developing, also please Give us a Bloodborne Remake, and a Demon Souls Port, It is time.",Negative

Отдать данный порт такой компании как Iron Galaxy, это было просто полнейшим идиотизмом со стороны Sony, т.к. в 2015 году, эта компания портировала Batman Arkham Knight, которую потом вообще убрали из продаж почти на целый год, пока не выпустили переработанную и играбельную версию. К слову за все время существования компании Iron Galaxy, она выпустила только один более менее достойный порт не очень то популярной игры, все остальные релизы оставляли желать лучшего.  Чем нужно было руководствоваться, что бы принять решение о найме данной компании для релиза на ПК одного из флагманских эксклюзивов Sony останется загадкой.P.S. Проходил данную игру давным давно еще на PS3 и затем на PS4, так что в целом впечатления от перепрохождения её на ПК не были особо испорчены этим ужасающим релизом, но не смотря на это я не рекомендую покупать данный продукт, особенно тем, кто в него не играл ранее. Я крайне не доволен политикой Sony в отношении как ПК геймеров, так и геймеров с платформ PS. Понятное дело, что рынок и прибыль решает, но что мешает Sony прислушаться к своему комьюнити и исправить многие спорные решения, которые не требуют особых финансовых затрат как на PS, так при релизах на ПК мне скорее всего понятно, предположу что это жадность и глупость тех самых ""эффективных менеджеров"" которые принимают решения как о развитии экосистемы PS, выборе компаний для портирования своих эксклюзивов и региональных ценах, использование которых крайне странно определяется для каждой страны или региона.",Negative

As it turns out, it can and how. The story told in ""One of Us. Part I,"" although first told 10 years ago, is still capable of touching, surprising, giving hope and telling one of the best video game stories in 2023.The development of the relationships between the main characters is interesting to watch, the secondary characters are well-discovered and their story is interestingly presented. The visuals of the game in 2013 were pretty good even for 2023, but in the ""Part I"" version, after the introduction of modern graphics technology in general is fire.Separately, I want to draw attention to the concept of the ""green apocalypse"", when the nature begins to regain its previously lost ground on the ruins of human civilization - it's very aesthetic in itself, and the game is also very stylishly depicted.I also want to note the attention to the approach in the design of the locations - if you went into an abandoned apartment, the setting, the interior, the small details of design, etc. - Everything literally immerses you in the atmosphere of the game.Great game lore, which is conveyed through the dialogues of the characters, the environment around, notes, and the overall story - can not leave anyone indifferent.If you, like me, love a heartwarming story, well-described characters, post-apocalyptic atmosphere, and an interesting world, then I can congratulate you - this game will be a godsend. ""You can't escape or hide from the past.

I'm not sure if this is physics or something that requires the engine to be cpu bound, but it runs at a barely acceptable 30fps with my setup no matter how much I've tweaked the settings. I'm holding some faith this will eventually get resolved in a future update but I would have to say the launch was a pure disaster. If I could get a refund I would, but due to the time it took for the shader building and just giving up playing it at 30fps, that's now too late (bought through the Epic store, not Steam) There's little to no chance I'm going to upgrade my machine's CPU for some marginal gain, so I guess I'm stuck with a $60 doorstop.",Negative

Ennek az oka, hogy alapból érdekelt a története és semmi érdekes vagy ténylegesen ""jó"" játék nem jelent meg mostanában. Aztán elérkezett a várva várt nap amikor megjelent a játék, én pedig másnap már játszhattam is vele. Vagyis nem egészen. Már rögtön az első indításnál a játék elkezdi Buildelni a Shadereit amiviel a fő probléma az, hogy kb 4-5 óráig csinálja (és persze ha elkezded a játékot a Shaderek nélkül kb 3 fps-ed lesz). Ez idő alatt minimum hetvenszer chraselt és **** be. Már itt látszott, hogy apc port a legnagyobb jóindulattal sem lesz okénak nevezhető, de pozitív maradtam. Cserébe viszont olyan szinten köpött pofán a Naughty Dog, hogy szóhoz sem jutok.(Amúgy nem értem a Shader dolgot. Miért kell a játékba? Ne mondja nekem senki azt, hogy ""Jobbá akarja tenni a játék az élményem ezzel a módszerrel"" mert a szintén idén megjelent Resident Evil 4 Remake minden féle shader baszakodás nélkül elfut a gépemen 60fps-el max grafikán. Nem is beszélve arról, hogy a RE4 vagy ötször szebb mint a Last of Us.)Na, de most jön a szartenger, ugyanis késöbb kiderült, hogy a Shaderes probléma még csak a jéghegy csúcsa volt; a játék úgy fut medium grafikán mintha switchen játszanám a God of War Ragnarök-ot. Többségében 15-20 fps-em van, de úgy néz ki néha szeretek Slow Motionban játszani olyan 6 fps-el. És most lehet mondani, hogy szar a gépem, de nem csak velem történik ez. Ha valaki rákeres akkor valszeg talál videót róla. Ezen kívül a játék általában 10-20 percig tölt (abba már bele sem megyek, hogyan tölt minden cutscene elött és után még 7 percig, a ""Kis türelmet..."" felirattal), és nem tudom, hogy ez az alap játék hibája-evagy egy bug, de az AI olyan KIBASZOTT buta, hogy simán szambázhatnak elötte a társaim vagy én is esetenként, mert olyan intenzitással fogják leszarni, hogy azt nem egyszer megkönnyeztem. És ezek még csak a technikai problémák, abba még bele sem kezdtem, hogy mi a problémám az alap játékkal.Először is, nem fogom végigjátszani, mivel egy csomó olyan dolgot elrontana a folyamatos frusztráltság a technikai része miatt, amiket alapból élveznék.ezért ha rendbe hozzák ezeket a gondokat, akkor adok neki még egy esélyt, ami valszeg fél év lesz minimum. Röviden a meglátásaim egyenlőre a játékról:a gunplay nem rossz, tetszik ahogy visszarúg a pisztoly, de a melee elég rossz. Egy gombot kell spamelni megállás nélkül és bár az animáció egész szép, összességében nem nagy élmény. Nagyon kevés a tényleges gameplay, sokszor csak megyünk előre percekig és semmi érdekes nem történik, ilyenkor nem játszunk ténylegesen a játékkal csak megyünk, cserébe viszont csinálhatjuk a legindokolatlanabb Quick Time Eventeket. Szóval sokszor kifejezetten unalmas. A karakterek és azok interakcióik egymással viszont zseniálisak. A Naughty Dog játékaira általában jellemző az ""Egyszerű történet, komplex karakterek"" formula, ami itt is észrevehető. Itt kiszeretném kiemelni a tökéletesen megírt és előadott párbeszédeket karakterek között.Összességében a fő problémám a játékkal az, hogy történetet mesél el és játékmenetében (főként a rengeteg QTEnek köszönhetően) elavult, ezért valószínüleg a sorozat a legjobb vélasztás a Last of Us átélésére(bár azt még nem láttam). Így játékként nekem kifejezetten unalmas.2/10 főként a borzalmas port miatt.",Negative

This broken piece of garbage is full of screen tearing and FPS drops. I don't even want to hear how this is Iron Galaxy's fault. If Naughty Dog hadn't been so cheap and lazy to do the port themselves, then there would be no reason to outsource this game to those garbage developers in the first place. I have made the decision to refund this garbage. Naughty Dog never fails to amaze me on how greedy and lazy they are. To make matters worse, this doesn't even have the multiplayer. Lazy developers only had to work on half of the game and they still couldn't get the job done. Ever since Bruce Straley left Naughty Dog, these lazy and greedy developers have not released any multiplayer, let alone a new game that's actually finished. TLOU2 doesn't count as it's still an unfinished game. It's been almost 3 years and I still haven't gotten multiplayer for TLOU2. Not even Capcom took that long to give me RE8 online, and that game came after TLOU2. That's embarrassing. At this rate, RE4 remake will have online before TLOU2. Seeing how ridiculously long Naughty Dog is taking with Factions 2, I will have high expectations for TLOU2 multiplayer. You better not disappoint me Naughty Dog.

A little later I noticed that my graphics card is loaded to 80-100 percent, and the processor at most 10.  For example, RDR2, Cyberpunk 2077, or that Uncharted 4 easily go with 60 fps on ultra settings without DLSS. In The Last Of US a constant drop in fps, constant freezes do not allow you to play the game normally. The game takes longer to launch on SSD than Spider-Man and Uncharted 4 together on HDD, it's impossible not to criticize. As far as I'm concerned, this is the worst port of this decade, and the worst among Sony games. One of the most important Sony exclusives came out very bad, no one expected this, but I hope that the optimization will be fixed as soon as possible, the sooner the better. I think that the bad scores that players are giving now are fully deserved, because the game is now difficult or even impossible to play because of horrible optimization. I'm sure the optimization will be fixed, and soon people will love it.

2747,wanted-dead,22-Feb-23,10,"Wanted:Dead is a very fun throwback action title but it comes with fundamental design flaws like a goth kid in school trying to look normal among his peers. Wanted:Dead is a not a normal game, not by a long shot. Very recently I played Valkyrie Elysium made by the same developer and both games feel very similar in terms of blandness. Valkyrie Elysium is a conservative RPG with good story and decent gameplay but it falls flat when creativity comes into play. There’s no creativity In Valkyrie Elysium, it feels tamed, most likely restricted by Square Enix. Like many other Square Enix titles these days, Valkyrie takes no chances and therefore loses its ability to wow. Wanted:Dead tries hard to be normal and very boring and stay in its lane but occasionally pulls the leash and delivers insane amounts of creatively satisfying content. The story is barely there and it’s very hard to follow and I was bored by the cutscenes until suddenly some artistic spark started coming out of the scenes at the cantina or the scene at the noodle bar. These moments make the game shine bright with charm and personality. Insane executions while wearing cat ears, face smudged in blood and then a quick smoke if you leave the controller idle. Real joy mixed with anger from the final mission that drags on forever. As a note I want to add that this game deserves way more love that it gets. Wanted:Dead is far from mediocre and this game has balls to be different in the day and age when all games are standardised and measured to feel exactly the same. 7/10",Positive

It just doesn't work in scenes. It gets cut, played in the wrong moments, etc.9 for each time I wanted to commit war crimes because of the checkpoint placement. It is the ""best"" part of the game, when you have to repeat 40 minutes of the gameplay after dying from the last enemy in the 6 waves! Unlikely, anyone from the development team will read this, but still... Seriously speaking, I get the inspiration from MGR. If you are able to continue working on the game series, look, what works there more. Both in terms of plot and gameplay.

However, this doesn't mean, that you have to give up. Even small changes with patches can make it much less frustrating - sound fix, add checkpoints is big sections, scale some props (gym is just super funny). Of course, some things like editing or plot structure can't be fixed already, unfortunately. Are you looking for any interns for the summer 2023?

This is the first time I will openly talk about a game that left an impression on me. This is probably what bipolar disorder feels like. I have been psychologically molested by Soleil and 110 Industries and it was one of the most memorable and amazing experiences in games I had in the past 5 years. Sometimes a game comes along and you buy it because of the cover art. This is how I did it. I have never seen a pink cover art on an action game before in my life. Nobody did. This is new. I come home and I start playing. My first impression is very bad. I don’t understand any of this and the game is brutally hard. First mission, I’m still not sold on it but I keep playing because I don’t know why. Usually I just toss the game if it sucks. Wanted: Dead didn’t suck at all but I just couldn’t get it. I stopped playing a lot of games mid way because they are boring. I’m looking at you God of War Ragnarok. Wanted: Dead has a fraction of GoW’s production values but somehow it keeps you entertained. Then I spent two hours picking toys in a crane game. Yes, I’m still talking about Wanted: Dead. Then I reached August and I felt like I was going to quit but when I finally kicked his ass it was a scream of joy. My GF ran into the living room to see what’s up. Then you are treated to a karaoke sequence that is real karaoke. Do you remember Just a Friend bit from Saints Row? This is exactly it but playable. Then Space Runaway. It’s an actual 16-bit SHMUP. Not a level or something. An actual arcade game was made for Wanted: Dead and when I unlocked it, I spent hours trying to beat it. Wanted: Dead surprises you every minute. The combat really opens up on the second mission when you progress further down the skill tree. The executions are gory and fun. There’s also a chainsaw.

2763,wanted-dead,15-Feb-23,10,"Like a lightsaber, Wanted: Dead is a relic of a bygone era. This game is a genuine love letter to the fans of Japanese action games. Wanted: Dead is a game of choices. Creative choices, political choices and game design choices. Let’s start with game design. Wanted: Dead is hard as nails. The combat is where the game shines the most. I managed to beat the game in 14 hours and I experienced no dull moment. The mini games are absolutely amazing and worth spending time with. The claw machine is especially addictive. Political choices. Anyone with their eyes open, and I don’t mean mainstream journalism, can see the social commentary on numerous issues. One of the key characters Vivienne provides world exposition in a cooking show. Comedic, obviously, but also prophetic. She’s teaching the audience how to cook synthetic pork and describes the world where she lives in - no fresh fruit, half-sapient vegan friendly cloned beef, human flesh flavored dog cans. China rules the world in Wanted: Dead and military convicts are the police. Good or bad but Hong Kong went completely nazi, ruled by a corporation. America, obviously, lost the war, hence the reversed American flag on Herzog’s body armor. Hannah wants to quit her job and raise a boy she orphaned but is denied of doing so. There’s a lot hidden under the blanket of extreme violence, corn and wacky presentation. Am I the only one seeing all this? Creative choices. Hiring a non-English speaker to voice the protagonist is a creative choice. It’s not a fake accent. Putting a “censored” sticker over a gruesome chainsaw kill is a creative choice. A shower scene that deconstructs the entire idea of Japanese fan service is a creative choice and a bold one. The female lead literally washes away the gore from her body and you get to see the scars and bruises she got during the operation. Everything in this game is made for you to think about what every other action game out there does wrong. Wanted: Dead is the Robocop of character action games. Think about it. Last bullet point should be called pink. Wanted: Dead is like no other game out there. The minimalistic artwork with bright pink background screams style and a a degree in graphic design. It immediately draws your attention. I purchased the collector’s edition that comes with Design Works. The attention to detail is absolutely incredible.

2768,wanted-dead,15-Feb-23,3,"Wanted Dead es un juego horrible, horrible, horrible… La “escritura” del juego (si es que se puede llamar como tal) en el mejor de los casos era risible de lo mala que era, en el peor de los casos se sentía como si me causara daño cerebral. La historia del juego es absurda, pero ese no es el problema, el problema es que tanto las actuaciones como los temas que se discuten son de los más mundanos y secos que se pueden encontrar; es como si quien quiera que dirigiese las escenas se propusiese la tarea de tratar de hacer que los personajes parecieran mas “casuales” o “naturales” pero en cambio terminan teniendo esta serie de conversaciones que no contribuyen a nada y son completamente arbitrarias. Hay una escena de 10 minutos donde los personajes solo hablan de los ingredientes del Ramen que se están comiendo. La jugabilidad es decente, es la mejor parte del juego, afortunadamente porque, al final, esto es un videojuego. Sin embargo, la jugabilidad no es lo suficientemente buena para sostener la mayor parte del juego; consiste en tratar de mezclar una serie de elementos que no sabe muy bien como balancear, te da la opción de bloquear ataques o desviarlos, cosa que se hace al bloquearlos justo antes de que te golpeen, de vez en cuando puedes herir a los enemigos lo suficiente para crear aperturas que te permiten realizar ejecuciones -que debo decir-, son bastante variadas y quizá la mejor parte del título. Es un juego violento y sangriento, estos elementos me gustan, simplemente desearía que no fuera tan repetitivo. La variedad de enemigos se divide en dos partes, los que disparan a distancia, y los que te atacan de cerca; el juego trata de proveer un tipo de control de disparos en tercera persona pero la mayor parte de las veces es sumamente poco satisfactorio, especialmente cuando en muchas ocasiones la mira y tus disparos se ven bloqueados por el modelo del propio protagonista… La inteligencia artificial es pésima, a veces los enemigos huyen de ti, otras veces se acercan demasiado, otras veces repiten el mismo ataque una, y otra, y otra vez. El balance de dificultad es ridiculo, extremadamente fácil en muchos casos con algunos jefes siendo absurdamente difíciles en otros, el juego cuenta con un sistema donde pueden revivirte tus colegas dos veces antes de tener que reiniciar desde el ultimo punto de control, pero en ciertas situaciones -como en algunos jefes-, el juego te deja sin esta capacidad, cosa que causa que repitas el jefe desde el inicio; la mitad de las veces es difícil saber que hacer para contrarrestar estos fracasos por que el juego tiene demasiados sistemas que no se enlazan uno con el otro. A veces quiere ser un juego de disparos, otras veces quiere ser un juego de acción similar a un “Hack’n Slash”; la mitad de las veces no logra ser parte de ningún género. Además, el juego es sumamente corto, aunque no entendería bien por que alguien quisiera extender su experiencia con él. Dura alrededor de 4 horas viendo las escenas; si se jugara en dificultades relativamente fáciles estoy seguro que se podría acabar en menos que eso. Éste es un juego que desafía la pregunta; “¿Cómo pudo crearse algo como esto?” En que cabeza cupo que era una buena idea; no lo sé. El juego lo recomiendo casi como un experimento sociológico para aquellos demasiado curiosos o tercos para no ignorar un juego que no respeta ni tu inteligencia, así como tu tiempo.",Negative

Amassing an army that can conquer the map is effortless. Gathering: Get used to the same buildings and roads over, and over, and over...Nothing upgrades, nothing can be made more powerful aside from assigning an extra resource to it. Everything is cheap to make, nothing takes effort. The Story: Is a joke. Who is writing these games for Ubisoft? Fire them. ""Hey there, just us oppressed Settlers,, the good guys cause we said so. Now lets go to a new island, amass an army, and slaughter every living person on it. Poor us."" Just laughable. Overall: It's another identity-less, watered down, Ubisoft product. Bad design.

The issues with crashes that the game has are bot helping the score as well, although quite a few has already been patched.Now to the positive side - the potential of the game is huge with it’s cross platform release and crossplay enabled.

The campaign is a snoozefest, soldiers have like 3000 ms built in lag before responding to any command, it's full of bugs, save game stops working, multiplayer is broken and desyncs, crashes, basically the multiplayer is unplayable. The only good part of the game is Hardcore Mode, where you can play skirmish maps with modifiers which rotate weekly, with allies in co-op. Unfortunately, the game doesn't auto matchmake you with an ally for these challenges. No big deal, you can ask around in the game's discord, right? Well, no. The game doesn't have a discord. You have to browse the forums and find some unofficial fan discords. Overall, nobody seems to care about this game. Ubisoft barely promoted it, the developers are pretty much absent, it's missing basic features, and is broken in many ways. It doesn't feel like Ubisoft expects you to buy this game, it feels like they expect you to pay a month of Ubi+ subscription, try it, realize it's bad and then uninstall it. Just casual mitigation of the financial losses that they had when it became clear that the development wasn't going anywhere.

This is a BAD and BORING RTS, why play this crap, if there are so many good RTS Games with various settings waiting ouit there for us?3. It's technically a DISASTER. How could this get relased?

2799,the-settlers-new-allies,21-Feb-23,5,"After 10 h, I am confident to say that it is a bad game. Bad in terms of not being fun to play. It is not a Settlers game, obviously, but a few points are: - It is 5/10 because I appreciate the experiment. I do not think that Ubisoft, with all its mismanagement and release fails of the past years, can handle innovation at this point.- Did you know that some Christian Hagedorn is the game's director, but apparently, the game designer behind Champions of Anteria from 2016 which originally also started as a Settlers game. We can take bets if Hagedorn's ego is mainly responsible for both game failures.- Ubisoft's desire to create a new PvP game type probably led to that LoL female announcer voice, which feels not only odd but, if you know Dota 2 or LoL, is just awkward and bad.- There is not much left of the chilling colony/settlement building game mechanics. If you need a base/colony builder, play Foundation or Farthest Frontier, to name a few.- We could go into detail regarding the horrible AI wave attacks, the surprisingly ugly UI, or how a baker is still baking without water, in terms of supply chains. But I think that these points are to be expected, if the original Settlers formula does not play a role anymore.- The campaign is awful and unimaginative. I didn't finish it, but do all scenes play in the same room, between the same 3 characters? The factions... I recall the early demo where they were different. Lore and factions do not matter at this point.- The influence of MOBAs and some competitive RTS is there, but Hagedorn, the design team, or whoever is or was in charge, clearly does not understand those genres. Settlers New Allies would probably be better off as an experimental game as its own new IP, I guess, like Champions of Anteria.- Let's hope that Hagedorn or Ubisoft do not try to create a SimCity MOBA game next. It is all about a lack of creativity and experience at game design, I guess, and how Ubisoft does not know on how to handle and check bad game designs internally. Because the art, the lighting, and I am pretty sure also the programming, if it was not been rushed, is rather solid.- It is perhaps worth mentioning that all Ubisoft Settlers games, since Settlers 5 (and we could argue about Settlers 7), have the reputation of being mediocre and a joke commercially. Ubisoft should sell this IP. Therefore, Settlers New Allies most likely mirrors the internal director and management problems that have plagued Ubisoft for years. It is beyond me why the Ubisoft management left the franchise to someone like Hagedorn who objectively failed before at the same franchise with the drama surrounding Champions of Anteria. The drama of the past months alone is worth an article. It is not only unprofessional. Ubisoft seems to be in some kind of internal crisis.",Average

2807,the-settlers-new-allies,20-Feb-23,1,"As a long time Settlers fan who started with Settlers II in 1996 I can't even find the right words for my disappointment with this latest entry in the series. After the rocky beta and a lot of player feedback I was expecting that they would put that feedback to good use and listen to the fans. But after they announced that they would not send out review copies, I got worries. If a publisher does not want outlets to test and report on their game before it launches, it's pretty clear what's going on. Being a huge fan, I still bought it and hoped for the best. Unfortunately, the game falls short in every aspect. Where older titles had complex wares that needed to be manufacturer, managed and distributed, this game has a very simplistic way of handling resources. When it comes to the Settlers games, this is the most barebone of resource management. There is barely any challenge involved with it. The features of the game are extremely lackluster and makes me wonder where all the development time went. Only 13 missions, no map generator, no map editor, the already mentioned most basic resource system and a weird combat system that does not really fit the series are some of the game's shortcomings. In addition to that, the game has severe technical issues and that might be one of the strongest reasons why they didn't want anyone to see how the ""finished"" game plays before launch. The game crashes very often and due to the terrible auto save feature I constantly lose a lot of progress. The graphics are disappointing, too. It looks like a game that might have come out a few years ago. I don't understand why they did not use a more modern engine. Although I must admit I have no problem with the graphical style itself. It's cute. All in all it's a 1/10 for me as a settlers fan. It might be fun for others, but to me it looks like a cheap use of the settlers IP for a quick cash crab.

I have decided to refund this poor excuse of a game. I have played just about enough to know that this garbage isn't worth a single penny. Even at $30, this game is still too expensive. It should have been free-to-play. The developers are asking for this game to be dead on arrival. I don't recommend this broken and unfinished game at all.",Negative

2846,blood-bowl-iii,25-Feb-23,0,"0, 0, 0, 0, 0!!!If I had to come up with a worse game release then this then there would barely be any contenders if at all, but let's begin with The pros:-New ruleset from 2020 onwards-4 new races are introduced within the 12 release-New Pitches which bring variety to the visuals and other customizable options like Cheerleaders. (Currently not really available)-New and enhanced graphics based of the great looking miniatures from Games Workshop.-Customizable Jersey. (Darker colors aswell as black itself are missing and will most likely be unlockable content).The neutral:-Season Pass System, bringing out new races, unlockable for free after 50-ish matches and paid after 3 months. (Currently not available)The bad:-Literally thousands of bugs. These range from performance leaks, rules not working as intended, ai taking the player hostage for 10 minutes, matches disconnecting crashing and randomly disconnecting with no way of reconnecting, memory leaks and many more-Preditory and exploitative monetization scheme which requires purchase of every cosmetic piece for every player from one team at a team at a time. Which are also heavily bugged making them easily disappear from your inventory.-Missing Content like the ability to spectate, or pause an online match aswell as admin tools for a league, no proper single player mode other the Campaign which is just 18 matches with no story or progression. No end of game Statistics or a visible rank list, Star player special rules, all unlockable content which can be unlocked through natural game progression in any mode is not available and much more. No chat, only emotes, which was probably the form of communication used for developing this game.-Working factions within the files of the game like Lizardmen, Shambling Undead, Goblins, Halflings, Underworld Denizen, Wood Elfs and Necromantic Horror sitting around with some of which being completed to 100% and a few may just not seem polishing touches but are playable other than that and are accessible with a few changes of code, similar with end of game Statistics and many other features which are just chilling in the files of the game, waiting to be sold over the span of 2 years when they are already done and accessable.-Delays summing up for 3 years total with not much progression if at all from the betas over time.-Unstable release causing players of the normal edition receiving content which was intended for the brutal edition (this problem has been addressed by giving brutal edition players additional goodies).-Stupid AI that can only defeat some certain Game Journalists or put up a fight against complete new comers to the game. This is especially apparent as somebody who spent over 100 hours playing the ai in Blood Bowl 2 or as someone who is aware of the strongest ai of them all in Blood Bowl 1. -Bad and exploitative communication with consumers on all social media sites, falsely advertising the product and directly lying to most questions, especially pre-release. Some of the moderation/community management team on the Discord being unaware either unaware of how their own game works or just willingly lying, for which I am unsure what is worse.-Non functional ranking system and matchmaking. A new player with a new team can go up against a team with up to two Million TV (that means a team that is twice as strong in team rating) that has benefits that no inducements or star players could ever balance out by the sheer amount of skills the enemy team has, where it becomes difficult for the enemy to even lose unless they are intentionally hurting their own team.-Microtransactions, mandatory part of the review of how I have to point out that this game has microtransactions, a monetization methode which is always immoral, even for free to play titles. (Which this game is not)-Online Play and Offline Play are two different accounts that do not interact with another in away way whatsoever, meaning if you play the campaign online and you wish to play offline then you will notice that your team just doesn't exist.-Poor visibility and sound design, rats will become invisible on the Nurgle pitch or similar. Constant white noise from the loud crowd that can only be reduced by lowering all effects and an ear deafening intro when launching the game which challenges the volume of the main menu theme of Counter-Strike:Global Offensive, extreme bass boosted songs on SoundCloud or most construction sites. -And in general Blood Bowl 2 being a superior product any way imaginable then this one. I mean even setting the animations settings are somehow worse then in the previous with the options being to display all, none or only armor breaks, which causes the game to ONLY display armor breaks and not something in between like in the past where it didn't show non armor breaks but showed most of everything else which was the setting everybody used and liked. Making this game INFERIOR!!",Negative

2849,blood-bowl-iii,24-Feb-23,0,"Now, I know it does sound dramatic to give a game a 0, as it does sound like a review out of anger, but please, do try and understand the logic: This game, in the version that it is on release, has no reason to exist, as, unless you REALLY want the updates on the rules, bloodbowl 2 is an superior game, for cheaper. To say that the launch was incomplete is being kind. The game is nowhere close to finished, as gamebreaking bugs, constant crashes and server issues have made it impossible to play it, especially when early access was sold as a bonus. I do not joke that I could not complete 70% of the matches I attempted to play, either because the server just decided to break, the DRM decided that I was not online, or a perpetual loop started because a player used a skill that is currently bugged, ensuring that I would have to alt-f4 out of the game or just watch some repeating animation. The micro-transactions are.... obscene. On a game where the target audience are at least aware of the tabletop, everything that involves customization is paid for in real life money. Such includes things that WERE already included in bloodbowl 2, and now, you will have to buy them INDIVIDUALLY for each player. (Not a joke, each gear, paid with real money, is for one player only). I am still torn on the new aesthetics of the game, and with such a negative review, I will not comment on such because it is a matter of taste. If you do like a more gritty filter, it should please you. I prefer the bloodbowl colors flying high, but again, that part is taste. All in all, I do not reccomend this product, as it is unfinished, monetized offensively agressive and is a downgrade from its predescessor in almost all areas. I sincerely do know that this was not by accident, as there is no excuse for what they did. To both new and old players alike, this is worse then the worst fumble you had....",Negative
2850,blood-bowl-iii,24-Feb-23,10,"Bon déjà pour commencer j'adore ce jeu! Je l'attendais avec impatience et enfin il est arrivé, oui même après plusieurs reports qui devenait de plus en plus inquiétant pour le développement, je ne baissait pas les bras et me dire qu'on allait bientôt pouvoir y mettre les mains dessus et c'est le cas! Bon pour commencer le jeu nous offre une grosse campagne bien garnie que malheureusement je n'ai jouer seulement peu de temps, mais qui a l'air assez complet et plutôt riche pour un jeu de ce genre et qui en plus est beaucoup, énormément, extrêmement et j'en passe des adjectifs plus poussé que blood bowl 2 mais pour le moment de ce que je constate la campagne pourrait durer presque une petite dizaine d'heures ce qui n'est pas négligeable comparé a blood bowl 2 que elle ne durait que quelques heures dans mes souvenirs. Les graphismes, j'adore les graphismes de ce jeu ils sont presque à couper le souffle oui certes c'est pas réaliste comme blood bowl 2 mais c'est plus cartoon, plus vibrant et plus coloré ce qui me donne toujours plus envie de garder l'oeil à l'écran mais je sait que il y a une partie qui préfère le côté plus réaliste de blood bowl 2 mais bon il faut au moins plaires à d'autres personnes. La customisation nous promet d'être énorme à partir de la saison 1 et les saisons futures et année futures pour l'instant la customisation est très limitée comme par exemple pour l'instant nous avons seulement droit à 1 Cheerleaders ou 3 coachs ce qui n'est pas énorme pour l'instant je vous l'accorde mais tout la customisation va grandir grâce au passe de combat qui s'appelle le malepierre qui j'imagine va coûter plus de 10$ et qui va faire grincer des dents je n'en doute même pas car si vous n'achetez pas le passe de combat vous allez rester très limitée dans votre customisation du personnage, Cheerleaders, coachs, terrains, tribune etc.... Pour ce qui est de l'IA je l'avoue elle est nul mais vraiment trop nul et je peux comprendre la déception des joueurs, Cyanide nous avait promis une IA améliorée et intelligente qui serait meilleur que blood bowl 2 mais elle est franchement ♥♥♥♥♥, elle fait de la ♥♥♥♥♥, dans une partie que c'est à en mourir de rire, à voir si ils vont l'améliorer, dans mon scénario je pense qu'ils vont essayer de l'améliorer a travers des mise à jour mais qui ne sera jamais abouti à avoir une bonne IA, et dans mon cas à moi je m'en fous un peu de l'IA car je joue seulement avec en mode campagne et de temps en temps dans le mode ligue pour m'améliorer un peu car je préfère largement jouer avec un vrai joueur mais je peux comprendre la déception des joueurs solo en ligue. Du côté de la bande sonore c'est un délice pour mes oreilles les sons sont excellents musique très bonne et bande sonore très agréable rien à redire dessus. Encore une fois je comprends la déception des joueurs car la plupart des options quasi obligatoire pour jouer comme par exemple mettre sur pause quand on joue en ligne dans le mode ligue qui va seulement arriver à la saison 2 de l'année 1 je peux comprendre le mécontentement qui devrait y être déjà disponible à la sortie du jeu. Pour conclure c'est mon préféré blood bowl largement meilleur que le 2 selon moi avec du contenu qui devrait sortir sur le jeu pour encore plusieurs et plusieurs années ce qui fait que le jeu sera encore plus supporté et mis à jour que blood bowl 2 est une bonne nouvelle selon moi et qui permet aussi à de nouveaux joueurs de pouvoir embarqué dans cet univers car oui lui au moins permets aux nouveaux joueurs de bien pouvoir apprendre et être moins perdu que les anciens blood bowl qui était moins friendly. Et oui encore une fois je comprends la grosse déception des joueurs mais je crois au moins fermement que la plupart des trucs que les gens grognent vont être réglés et oui blood bowl 2 aussi n'était pas parfait à sortie donc je crois vraiment qu'on devrait lui accorder un peu de temps et de chances car je crois vraiment qu'il a un énorme potentiel. Donc oui foncez le prendre, au prix qu'il coûte je crois pas qu'il vaut la peine d'attendre une promotion pour ceux qu'il veulent l'essayer donc je vous dis bon blood bowl et c'est l'heure du match!!!",Positive

The narrator is absolutely perfect and brings the game to life. The ending is 100% Roberta and a real callback to the imaginative days of Sierra.

2859,colossal-cave,8-Feb-23,8,"This game is special, not only because it marks the most welcome return of Ken and Roberta Williams to game design, but also playing it made me feel like I did as a kid experiencing King's Quest for the first time - a sense of wonder while exploring a world full of surprises round every corner. The objective of the game is simple - find all the treasures hidden in the cave - but finding your way through its mazelike passages and great caverns is far from simple. Fortunately there's an automap feature that maps your progress as well as any items you've dropped, as unlike most other adventure games you can't put an infinite number of items down your pants ;) I was thrilled to play the game as it was being developed and got totally hooked exploring every nook and cranny of the cave, and even when you reach the end it feels like there's something else to discover. I would have liked to see more NPC interaction or expansion in certain areas, and players may not fully appreciate it without any knowledge of the text adventure. However as Ken and Roberta Williams have stated, this is not just a game it's like a historical document of a fundamental part of gaming history that deserves to be preserved!",Positive
2860,colossal-cave,6-Feb-23,10,"Colossal Cave is a bit of a breath of fresh air if you just want to relax and explore without the toxicity of some of the other games on the market. It's wholesome, fun for all ages, and surprisingly challenging! This game does its best to match the original text adventure without adding or twisting too much. It does a great job of conveying that silly, almost classic dungeon master style, but with a relaxing point and click interface. It's a game that doesn't take itself too seriously and doesn't inject anything unnecessary, it just stands on its own. You can tell that the designers loved the original enough to stay true to it. The original game had its flaws of course, but that's part of what made it a part of history. For what it's worth, I think it's very impressive for such a small indie team to release on this many platforms. Even though this game started out as a pet project, I can appreciate the effort that went into this to get it out the door.",Positive

2863,colossal-cave,3-Feb-23,9,"This games is a special game created by a special breed of people. People who once led the industry in game design and pioneered technologies we now take for granted. People who came out of retirement to create a game that was as close to a perfect recreation of the game that is responsible for the entire adventure genre of gaming. People who I personally believe are the only reason this game is as good as it is.I went into this game with a full understanding of the game it comes from. I can say with all honesty, it is a faithful game interpretation that unless you have an old microcomputer laying around or understand emulation, will be the best chance of ever playing the original.It is hard, it is obtuse, it is everything the original was, but with beautiful graphics. It will make you feel alone, it will try you, it will confuse you, it may even anger you--but if you beat it, it will give you a sense of accomplishment most modern games will never give you. The graphics are beautiful for a AA game release. You will see some problems. If the tree in BOTW bugged you, the trees here may too. There are seams in some textures--which I am hopeful they will work out in future patches. The creature textures are gorgeous--a little shiny in a few but scales reflect light more than rocks--though the movement of a few creatures are a bit wonky. But, hey, if that is your only complaint, you are doing quite well.Ambient sound shines. Dialogue is very well done--especially the narrator who reads the original 70s era text to you. When I first played it I thought the gain might have been a bit too high on a few things, but I adjusted easily enough.Controls are great, with two options. One is the traditional point and click controls like you would find in classic 90s Sierra Adventures. The other is WASD and Mouse, which is more modern and more familiar to me. I played with that setup. I did not try for a controller, but if it is not there, I would hope they add it in in future patches. As for negative, I only have one real thing to say. This game is not for everyone. If you thrive on needing others in your game with you, know this is a single player game only. It is spelunking a cave. You are alone almost the whole time. Encounters are rare as most of the game is exploring and finding your way through puzzles. This is a feature as the original game was built that way. If you can not handle a game designed that way, you will not like this game. If you are okay with that kind of challenge, or you grew up on microcomputer text adventures and/or classic graphic adventures from Sierra or Lucas Arts--then this game is calling out your name. My overall advice: Buy it. Play it. Beat it. Do something only a rare segment of the world has done: conquer the Colossal Cave.",Positive

Like in Far Cry 6, the enemies are not especially challenging - AI could use some tweaking. Ignore the haters bandwagon, it may not be the best game ever but I'd say it's a solid FPS that's more about fun than challenge. EDIT:Gave up after 30 hours.

Who doesn't want a vampire shooting game made by Arkane? Unfortunately, reality sunk in during my time playing it... while the gunplay and some mechanics were fun to mess around with, the overall game was just... meh. The story wasn't great and well... the enemies were a bit too easy. The AI would get stuck in places, and the bosses were a ton easier than the normal vamp[ires that circled around the city. The NPCS also just didn't have dialogue unless they were important to the quest line. Most of them would just answer back with grunts and there was one that just straight-up ignores the players. The textures lacked a ton for a next-gen experience and for $70 slideshow cutscenes were definitely the last straw. Thankfully GamePass saved me $70 dollars, this game needed another year or two or just scrapped altogether because it wasn't the hit I thought it would be. Jacob and the gunplay are what save this from going lower on the score.

I would be lying however, if I said that it was awful. It's just not good, which is something people can't seem to understand these days. Also, 90 percent of the people reviewing this are getting it from gamepass, so they're definitely just being a bunch of babies.",Negative

Vampires are almost the same, boooring. The same about the rest of enemies..I really expected something like outriders, darktide, vermintide or l4d/b4b.Here no citizens fighting with vampires, lack of various self-proclaimed bands, lack of fights between vampires and controlled be them servants, fanatics.. City is boooring so much.Why , the hell, they did open world: it is power consuming and game is so poor because of that. mentioned similar games are heaven better.Anyway if you like this graphic style,  have a time you can try...but this is for sure game to play with friends.",Negative

2900,redfall,14-May-23,2,"I'm actually sad about it. I love coop games, since playing with my friends is always a good experience in games like that - even when the game itself it's not actually good. Redfall is not even sustainable as a substructure to the fun. Why? simple enough. Poor gameplay. Its AI is horrendous. I remember playing smartphone games with smatter enemies than in this game. The skill tree is the definition of a ""modern rpg"", when the abilities do not actually matter and are overinflated to give you a sensation of a lot of content. The inventory is crazy bad. You gain a lot of weapons too fast and the overall experience is unbalanced, even on hard difficulty. Also, there's no need to work together since no actual treat requires that, so the abilities are kinda useless at some point. The only ok thing is the weapons design. Poor story. Most of it is told by static images - this game costs 70$ - and documents. No actual storytelling, I can assure you. NPC dialog? forget it. And how does the narrative influence the gameplay? oh, grab that and that, and that and bring it right here. That's it. Poor optimization. Alright, I'm already used to it since PC ports are usually bad in the generation. As a Ryzen 5 1600 owner, that actually gets worse since my CPU can't take some bad games. Even that, I never saw something run so bad on my PC. Jesus. Constant stuttering and FPS drop. I was playing at 25 fps sometimes, and reducing the graphics quality didn't do anything. The funny part is when you enter an underground map - separate from the open world - and the fps goes to 80 right away. I do not recommend this game. If you have gamepass, you can try it later, but not right now.",Negative

2902,redfall,14-May-23,0,"Redial, the highly anticipated release from XYZ Studios, falls far short of its promise and is a prime example of a poorly executed video game. Despite its flashy marketing campaign and initial excitement, Redial fails to deliver on multiple fronts, leaving players frustrated, bored, and ultimately regretful of their purchase. One of the most glaring issues with Redial is its lackluster gameplay mechanics. The controls feel clunky and unresponsive, making even simple tasks a frustrating ordeal. The combat system, which should be a highlight of any action game, is marred by poor hit detection and repetitive animations. Instead of engaging battles that keep players on the edge of their seats, fights in Redial quickly become tiresome and predictable, lacking any depth or strategy. Furthermore, the game's storyline is convoluted and poorly developed. The narrative is riddled with plot holes, inconsistent character motivations, and a complete lack of emotional investment. The dialogue feels forced and unnatural, failing to establish any meaningful connections between the player and the game's world. It's a missed opportunity to create an immersive experience that players can truly get lost in. Visually, Redial is a disappointment as well. The graphics, touted as cutting-edge during the game's promotional campaign, are underwhelming and fail to impress. The environments lack detail and variety, making each level feel monotonous and uninspired. Character models suffer from stiff animations and lackluster design, further detracting from any potential visual appeal. To add insult to injury, Redial is riddled with technical issues. Frequent crashes, game-breaking bugs, and long loading times plague the experience, disrupting any semblance of enjoyment that players might have had. It's evident that the developers rushed the release without adequately addressing these critical problems, leading to a frustrating and unfinished game. Even the sound design in Redial is subpar. The music lacks depth and fails to create the intended atmosphere, often feeling like an afterthought rather than an integral part of the gaming experience. The voice acting, if present at all, is mediocre at best, with unconvincing performances that further contribute to the game's overall lack of immersion. A Disappointing Game Experience In conclusion, Redial is a highly disappointing game that fails to deliver on its promises. With its clunky gameplay mechanics, poorly developed storyline, lackluster visuals, technical issues, and subpar sound design, it's hard to find redeeming qualities in this title. Players are advised to steer clear of Redial and invest their time and money in more polished and engaging gaming experiences available on the market.",Negative

For multi players you can bump the rating up to a 2, but wait till it's on sale for $20 max, that's all it's worth. $70 is an outrage for this half-baked, buggy and overall UNDERwhelming sh!+show.For $70 you get slide shows instead of cinematics, AI that doesn't work, assets that have the wrong proportions (hands!)! and an empty game world. Textures are in 2D in a distance and only become 3D objects at a (very) close distance. The shooting isn't really good either, especially since the enemy AI is braindead and you can literally walk up to enemies and one-shot them with a backstab (no sneaking required). Some enemies can't get around a vehicle and get stuck in an endless walking animation. Various items are highlighted with the prompt ""press E"" but are not usable in any way (such as small vehicles or even NPCs, this seems like some features were just cut last minute. Then there's the bland cliche Player characters, one of whom is in student debt (really???) and generic sniper. Side Quests are simple fetch quests that are boring as hell.

The game fails to showcase the potential of the Xbox Series X, with missions becoming repetitive and tedious. Even the promised unique vampire nests turn monotonous. The final boss fight is underwhelming, reducing the player to a button-masher. Human enemies lack intelligence, and the story unfolds through poorly animated paintings.

Can't remember anything near as bad as this in terms of performance/frame rate dips, and I played Cyberpunk 2077 at launch. My PC can normally run most games on high+ settings no problem. But there is just not a good game buried under the performance issues. The gun play is simply awful. The world is zero fun to explore, the firefights are also no fun.

The first cut-scene is entirely unrelated to you or your character. I also don't understand what the music is trying to express at any point.

Character design also took a hit... looking plain awful if you ask me.  There are far too many problems bogging down Redfall to name here in a brief review (nobody will read)... but there is a slim chance... a glimmer of hope really... that this games most serious shortcoming could be resolved, and there's and even smaller chance the game could be good someday.  In the meantime... the world space is fun enough to just romp around in once with Game Pass, or another subscription.  I wouldn't pay $70 for this game... let alone $100+ for a premium version with a bunch of totally unnecessary cosmetics.  I will say this:  It's pretty obvious the game was going to have some kind of MTX or battle passes or something... it has that kind of a stink on it... which is really bizarre since... that's the not the game that was released.

First of all lets talk about a significant part of the game and it is surprize surprize is bugs (nowadays it probably standard that game has some issues but this game has a lot of). in this game you can meet ""t-pose"" of characters and enemies, AI is also kinda broken that enemies on the location completely ignoring player, a lot of visual bugs with light system and LOD. And what interesting without this bugs game will stay OK and it perfect word to describe this game it kinda enjoyable and nothing more, game doesn't contain anything that can be eye catching or memorized. Yeah its co op open world but it feels kinda empty for it size and it really not so big. weapon system is also kinda strange some weapons has sub stats that can improve it stats but game doesn't show the base stats so message as increasing acc by 10% is kinda meaningless. Plot is also interest part of this game i mean it interest that devs also decide to save some money on cutscenes so it static pictures with copyright free music (at least it feels like it actually free). furthermore structure of the game looks like developers want to artificially stretch the playing time by make system like: open shelter, kill 3 minor boss to be able to kill mid level boss after you can do the same thing two more times and only after it you be able to kill final boss that actually can be killed by pressing F button 3 times. So who can enjoy this game ? probably someone who has gamepass to play it cheaper than 70$ and that person already completed every game on his list and just want to skip two evenings with his friend.for everyone else i don't think it that experience that expect player that saw ""from the creator of dishonored and prey"" in every trailer and price in 70$.",Negative

Writings litter the grounds, ammo and resources are easily replenished at the home base, the level design accommodates all players. I was shocked how very little the game asked of me to be creative, to find my own solution, to bring in my own tactics. I was raised in a household where I finished my plate, so I stubbornly pushed through to the end. I sincerely hope this doesn't drain any more resources from Arkane Austin and that they're given the green light to pursue another single-player, deliberately measured experience that welcomes and encourages player creativity and ingenuity to navigate its playspaces and engage with its obstacles.",Negative

2993,redfall,3-May-23,0,"Welp I won't lie by saying that the first time we saw the game being revealed, nobody was thinking this would be GOTY material. Still, Arkane Studios produced amazing games, even if none were 10 out of 10 (at least in my opinion). So let's start with this. First of all, I've refunded the game within the two hours I played it on Steam for a few reasons. Trying to play with a friend was a nightmare, not the one sold by the studio's sales pitches. Being disconnected on both sides, being logged out from the Arkane server, and the game simply crashing. When we manage to play for a little bit, we've met some of the wonkiest IA that even The Elder Scrolls couldn't fight for the crown. Either they just didn't bother attacking us, they ended up being iddle while being killed, or, worst scenario, they got stuck in an unkillable death loop (hehe, see the pun?) Sorry). The NPC weren't any better when it was possible to see them or when they weren't trying to intimidate us while t-posing. The last thing that bothered us (at least me) was that we ended up in his game and noticed that he was the only one being able to progress his save (MAJOR BUZZ KILL). So yeah, I went to look forward to playing at being horribly disappointed and lacking any faith when this was supposed to be a finished product that was pushed back to make sure everything was fine. It could have easily been released a year after the release today, and maybe, just maybe, it would have been a great game with the signature of Arkane magic. Clearly, this time the only magical moment I encountered was the moment my refund was allowed right away via Steam refund. All I can say is that not being able to play the game without issues every 5–10 minutes makes it impossible to review and even give a point to this. Arkane Studios (or Microsoft, I don't care who to blame TBH) deserve that massive L from the players to understand that releasing a product in such poor condition is not acceptable today, no matter if the game can be rented via Game Pass (which I love being a sub for from time to time) or paid the full price (like I did since I love to own my game). We have so many options today, from F2P games that are sometimes better than AAA games to indies to obviously major releases from big box stores, so how the hell did they think this was something that people wouldn't hold on to? Welp, this deserves a big zero, and I sure hope they'll move forward and fix the games with at least an apology to people who wanted to support them and enjoy a brand new IP. This will most likely be their last attempt at creating a brand new game. I have that feeling. Con's Horrible optimisation (even with a 11700k and RTX3080)Always onlineNo private serverKeep crashing.server not being able to handle solo or co-opOutdated graphics (not having a unique style like previous games)Wonkiest AI since The Elder ScrollsGraphics glitch: removing all textures of friends in coop, of the NPCs, and of the enemiesAI is 100% broken at random times (not moving, not seeing us in front of them, etc.).NPCs are straight-up death-looking people from A Nightmare on Elm Street (hi Freddy).Gameplay being generic (but not horrible)Else...

The character models are clunky and lack detail, the animations are stilted and robotic and the AI is a shame compare to previous Arkane title. It will just be forgotten.",Negative

Anyone reviewing giving this higher then a four is a shill, or one them sad, lonely crooked teeth, moms box-room dwelling Xbox fanboys who won’t accept that this generation of console is a flop minus game pass. So the game; graphics and performance= awful. People always try to say “it’s an art style!” With Arkane which is usually is; this however is just plain and nasty. The most boring open world I’ve played an I’ve played some bad ones, doesn’t make you want to explore, it’s a chore moving across the map. Everything feels flat and uninteresting, which is insane considering how good Dishonoured and Prey still look to this day. I don’t understand how they can make a game that looks worse than previous gen titles.The performance, get some frame drops here and there and their seems to be some latency input no matter what I do, then sprinkle in all of the bugs I’ve experienced in 6 hours of playing (guns disappearing, enemies moving/freezing like they’re cardboard cutouts, sniper scope getting stuck on my screen even though I’m using other guns etc.) it’s honestly quite outstanding how bad this game is and the fact it’s been put out. To anyone finding even a slither of enjoyment in this; I salute you. But do not kid yourself or others that this is even close to half-decent gaming experience, an quit trying to boost review numbers for a game that’s awful. You only make things worse by defending these studios that release games as bad as this, allowing more and more studios to do the same.

And to have the absolute audacity to charge $70 for this? $70 for the base game? It's ludicrous. It's absolutely ludicrous. Especially for a garbage port. There are games that you can get that were released this year for half that price that run better, look better, have a better story, and are overall just a better game.

In my honest opinion they cant delay Starfield because they delayed 2 time already but i cant either launch it like redfall was.

3067,redfall,2-May-23,1,"RedFall ReviewRating: ★★☆☆☆RedFall, the highly anticipated game from a renowned studio, falls far short of expectations, failing to deliver an engaging and immersive experience. From its lackluster gameplay mechanics to its uninspired world design, this game left me feeling bored and unenthused.One of the biggest letdowns of RedFall is its gameplay. While the concept of battling vampires in an open-world setting sounded intriguing, the execution falls flat. The combat mechanics are repetitive and lack depth, with a limited variety of weapons and abilities that quickly become tiresome. The enemy AI is disappointingly simplistic, making encounters predictable and lacking any real challenge. It's a shame that a game centered around vampire slaying fails to create thrilling and intense gameplay moments.Moreover, the open-world design feels lifeless and uninteresting. The game world lacks meaningful exploration and fails to offer engaging side quests or activities to keep players invested. The environments lack variety and fail to captivate the imagination, resulting in a world that feels bland and forgettable.The narrative is another area where RedFall disappoints. The story fails to grip the player's attention or create a sense of urgency. The characters are poorly developed, lacking depth and relatability. The dialogue often falls into clichés and fails to evoke any emotional investment. It feels like a missed opportunity to create an immersive and compelling narrative within the vampire genre.Technical issues also plague RedFall. The game suffers from frequent glitches and performance problems, including frame rate drops and long loading times. These issues significantly hinder the overall experience and detract from any enjoyment that could have been found within the game.Furthermore, the multiplayer aspect, which was meant to be a highlight of RedFall, is underwhelming. The cooperative gameplay lacks innovation and fails to offer anything truly unique or exciting. It feels like a missed opportunity to create an engaging multiplayer experience that could have added replay value to an otherwise lackluster game .In conclusion, RedFall fails to live up to its potential, offering a dull and unremarkable gaming experience. The lackluster gameplay mechanics, uninspired world design, and underdeveloped narrative make for a forgettable game that fails to capture the imagination. Save your time and money and look elsewhere for a more engaging and enjoyable gaming experience .",Negative
3068,redfall,2-May-23,0,"I have played the game for more time than I wanted and I was bored to tears on how empty and devoid of fun it is. Not even a good experience as a shoot and loot game. Not a good experience as an open world. Poor ai, poor controls, input lag, low performance, bugs, clipping, lack of interactivity, lack of story, even cutscenes, interesting characters are nowhere to be found. It’s a mess…This is an embarassment of a game. It should have never been launched in this state. Not even a AA by this point. It looks like something a small studio with big ambitions would make. Xbox continues to churn out trash and trick their consumers. The trailers we’ve seen for this game have all been substantially altered and scripted which gives out the unrealistic idea that this is a much better game then it actually is. A case where expectation vs reality is lost. I regret buying an xbox and giving microsoft a second chance (more like tenth chance). I’m not even hoping that starfield will be that good and this is proof that microsoft should stop buying studios an publishers and start getting their act together with what they have.…",Negative

If I'd paid money for this then I'd be wanting it back, as it is Gamepass made it just a waste of my time to try. The main issues for me were that for a lootershooter the loot available quickly loses any incentive and the shooting is never exciting. The gameplay loop got stale very, very quickly. Poor combat, poor AI, no real sense of exploration, a nagging feeling that the open world has gone from trying to create jump scares into just sterile emptiness, weird design decisions on multiplayer (only host progresses, really? It's 2023), and then layer on animation glitches and other engine streaming hiccups and occasional stuttering... My goodwill evaporated rather quickly. Strengths are the little story telling moments within the world, but these are so smothered by having to design around a co-op looter shooter, and that there are moments of fun to be found with a friend in combining skills traversing and clearing areas. It's not a lot to hold up even a dozen or so hours of play. Not the worst game I've ever played but not one I'll be returning to at any point either.",Negative

Mediocre visuals, mediocre performance, mediocre story, mediocre length, mediocre variety, mediocre single player experience (when they told us it was primordially thought as a single player game, with a multiplayer mode), mediocre experience when you need to be connected to the internet all the time to play the game, etc. It's all bad news with this game! And you know what? It's 70 bucks! The only thing that's a bit fun is the multiplayer, but for just a couple of short hours.

Hace 30 años esto no pasaba y ya basta que estas compañías nos estén viendo como peones y beta testers para al cabo de 6 meses tener el juego como debió haber salido. Redfall es un Triple A que no aporta nada, no innova, si lo comparamos con un FPS como Crysis del 2007 o Far Cry 2, estos se comen vivo a Redfall en cuanto a mecánicas, diversión, jugabilidad y físicas. Qué un título Triple A del 2023 siga haciendo lo mismo que FPS de la década de los 128 bits es una vergüenza inaceptable. Las fallas del juego van desde su código fuente y desde su concepto y como se planteó el juego en la pre-producción. Esto no se va a arreglar con parches, porque tendrían que hacer lo mismo que hizo Square Enix con el Final Fantasy XIV, que lo tuvieron que rehacer de nuevo y relanzarlo. Aquí esa posibilidad no va a existir porque Redfall se va a convertir en el primer título deficiente de Arkane. No lo compres a menos de que esté a menos de 10 USD si únicamente te mola el concepto de los vampiros. De todas formas lo tienes en el Gamepass y lo puedes probar desde allí y vas a concordar con la mayoría de las notas de los usuarios con este título tan decepcionante.",Negative

However, I would not recommend anyone play this game at all and just simply skip it in general. The game utilizes 17GB of VRAM at 1440p with DLSS. I was shocked to see that this game was reaching the VRAM limit of my desktop 4090, I tried lowering the graphics from Ultra to High but that didn't change a single thing, and left me wondering if there is a memory leak somewhere in the game that is causing this. Because I for sure am not seeing amazing visuals for that utilization, a game like Tomb Raider 2013 or even Titanfall 2 looks a lot better than this. Gameplay is very mediocre and boring, sure the premise of the game is to run around and defeat vampires but it gets super tedious in the long run. Another thing I dislike is how most of the weapons feel and fire the same way, yes the amount of damage each gun would do is different but the feel of using them in-game is just the same across. The story is meh as well, I only played for 2-3 hrs so can't give a concise answer on that front but it doesn't seem to be interesting. Overall I would not recommend anyone pay $70 for this game, let alone not get GamePass just for this game.

The missions and side content the infiltration and mystique. Coming from someone that has been a Hardcore Arcane fan since playing Dishonored on the Xbox 360 and have been playing everything since. It is heartbreaking to see a game that feels like it should have been their first outing where they learned all of their mistakes and would build up to Dishonored and Prey. However unfortunately that is not the case. While playing you even feel that it is a freshman outing as the graphics are worse than Dishonored and it came out in 2012. I haven't quite completed it yet but with as easy as the AI is to fool that shouldn't take long as I am using the same stealth approaches I used in the previous games and I can pretty much take out all the humans and then clean up the vampires without much more than an occasional Yellow question mark.",Negative

The main character mentions a theatre in the gameplay trailer saying ""i used to go here all the time"" implying that shes the regular Morb fan who always went to theatre when it was morbing time thus getting extraordinary powers from not pirating Morbius and enjoying it in cinemas everytime Now together they must destroy the morb thirsty vampires before they eradicate every Morb on planet earth making Morbius a forgotten gem it is a theory that Phil Spencer himself gave the order to delay the game and cancel the Playstation port cause Sony refused to put Morbius in the game and Spencer decided that he would include the cinema that he himself is highly dedicatedSpencer sharing my vision of the Morbius movie ive come to realise Redfall is one of if not the best games ever made and its the closest thing we can get to a Morbius game thus i give this game a clear 100/10.

3148,redfall,2-May-23,3,"Ich mag Arkane eigentlich.Ihre Games sind immer auf gewisse Weise eigen, aber spaßig.Grafisch gesehen waren ihre Games nie die Oberliga, aber der Stil passte zum jeweiligen Game, hässlich waren sie nie. Aber dennoch war da immer das Gameplay, welches alles wieder ausgeglichen hat. Doch Redfall versagt auf allen Linien für mich. Grafisch ist es grottig, selbst bei maximalen Details. Stellenweise sogar schlechter als ""Dishonored 2"". Was für mich nicht schlimm wäre (Gameplay > Grafik). Aber das Gameplay ist ebenso schwach. - Das Gunplay fühlt sich nicht gut an. Gegner sind meist Bulletsponges und typische ""RPG-Like"" Abschüsse mit HP-Balken - Nicht so schlimm, wie in Fallout (hier sind Headshots zumindest bei den meisten Twinks insta-Kill), aber dennoch nervig. Den meisten Waffen fehlt die Wucht. - Die Open World ist langweilig. Zu 90% der Zeit läuft man durch leere, tote Landschaften, hin und wieder plättet man eine Gegner-Gruppe oder findet die ein oder andere kleine Notiz. Der selbe Schwachsinn wie bei ""Generation Zero"". Ja, es ist keine typische ""Kazillion-Fragezeichen-Türme-Erkletter-Ubisoft-Welt"", aber ganz leer sollte diese auch nicht sein. - Die Story kann absolut nicht mitreißen. - Die Fähigkeiten sind ganz cool, aber pro Charakter zu wenige, um wirklich coole Builds zu ermöglichen; Mir fehlt die Freiheit, wie bei Dishonored. - Laut Arkane im Solo spielbar, ist es dennoch spürbar auf Ko-op ausgerichtet. Zu oft begegnet man Gegner-Gruppen, die für einen Spieler alleine zu viel sind; viel zu viele Mechaniken behindern einen Solo-Run einfach nur, Stand jetzt fühlt sich das Game für mich wie ein stark heruntergebrochener Loot-Shooter an, wie eine BETA von einem Destiny-Klon., nein, eher sogar wie eine Alpha davon. Und besonders enttäuscht mich dabei, dass ich von Arkane besseres gewohnt bin. Wie kann es sein, dass das Game grafisch schlechter aussieht, als Deathloop, welches 2 Jahre vorher erschien? Wieso übernimmt Arkane nicht alte Stärken aus Prey, Deathloop und Dishonored und macht stattdessen so ein aus der Zeit gefallenes 08/15 Loot-Shooter-Ding draus? Bin nur froh, es nicht GEKAUFT zu haben, sondern über den Gamepass zu spielen.

The story is structured and presented as an early 90s action film, perhaps as a means of making the younger versions of its now aged cast make more sense, but it unfortunately also has all of the poor representation, objectification, and ham-fisted dialogue those movies are known for, And not even in a fun way. There is also a forced attempt to be “wacky” that doesn’t do the game any favors.

Some of the AI actions will frustrate players as well but overall I'm very happy and I like that the game doesn't take itself too seriously and there is an interesting diverse cast of characters. I'm a little disappointed as some gameplay is getting in the way of completing objectives and I wish there was an option to join a friend's campaign as a hired team member, but overall I am loving the game after tens of hours and plan to continue playing. Crime Boss will offer good options on stealth and customizing your character's weapons but if you're happy with repeating the campaign, interested in how to find out alternative steps to find new missions, and especially if you have someone to try this game with I hope people give it a chance. DLC when?",Positive

3171,crime-boss-rockay-city,2-Apr-23,4,"I heard about this game in December 2022, and since the trailer was so well done, I was eagerly anticipating it with hope and joy... Let me say straight away that my hopes were pretty much dashed in less than 2 hours of gameplay. After completing the tutorial and making progress in the campaign, my verdict on the single-player experience is extremely mixed. It's very reminiscent of Payday 2 (at this point, one could even call it plagiarism) in remastered 2023, which means it's graphically pumped up on steroids and simplified to the extreme in terms of management and gameplay. The campaign feels like a dud, the kind of high-budget Hollywood action movie that's overacted by the actors and in which you participate in a few action scenes that are ultimately pointless. The budget seems to have been absorbed by the cast, which may be the only positive aspect of the game when it's forgotten in 6 months. There's no creativity in the gameplay or the story; it's all very basic. The actors overplay their parts, it's a real flop. However, it could become a cult classic, and at times I wondered if the entire scripted part was meant to be a big joke. What a waste for these good '90s action stars who seem lost in this production. But let's get back to the gameplay. It's not an open world, you can't explore the city, you can only choose missions in a particular location, and it's always the same: infiltration, action, extraction... In Payday 2, during the extraction phase, we sometimes, or even often, had an accident, and we had to transfer the loot from the crashed van to a new vehicle, which added extra tension at the end of the heist. We never knew if we were going to get away ""easy"" or if we were going to have to face the police again, in the middle of an intersection, next to a park. But there's none of that in Crime Boss. In Rockay City, the cops mind their own business. In short, I'm very disappointed at the moment. As for multiplayer, I get the impression that you can only play with your Epic friends, not with random guys... I still hope that the developers will improve the game in the future or that the rest of the single-player campaign will be better than its beginning. Even though what I've seen is lackluster, the game has considerable potential, and if the developers add the missing features, it could become a reference. In conclusion, here's my advice: if you like Payday 2, stick with it; if you don't like Payday 2, you won't like Crime Boss (it's the same gameplay, with ultra-simplified complexity, wrapped in modern graphics and a poorer story); and if you don't know Payday 2, wait for the third opus, which should come out this year. Today, I give it a 4/10 for the cast, Kim Basinger, the graphics, and the technical execution (I haven't encountered any bugs yet). I'll revise my rating later based on my continued experience with the game.",Negative
3172,crime-boss-rockay-city,1-Apr-23,1,"Wasted potential...they may add more content and polish the game later...but atm...Repetitive in all aspects...gameplay without any innovation as you progress + small repetitive environments + too simple management like in some mobile game, leaving you with no motivation to keep playing. Ally and enemy AI is really bad in this game with simple commands and no possibility to create team tactics. Sadly the quality of writing, dialogues and voice acting which was the main selling point for this game is also more on the bad side and not in a good way. Graphics look like 5+ years old game.

3175,crime-boss-rockay-city,31-Mar-23,8,"When you actually play the game, it is surprisingly fun. Don’t get me wrong, there are issues with writing, gameplay variety - but some of these could be improved in updates. One of the biggest issues is that developers don’t properly explain all game elements and mechanics. Fun came when you understand how to play this game. For example  reviewers criticizing stealth probably don’t know all options they have. In addition to stealth takedowns (which are unreliable sometimes), you can disable cameras and then use shouting + zip-tying for crowd control, which is applicable also to guards.Campaign have novel ideas and is both challenging and fun. I like rogue-like elements, not enough variability and writing is the biggest issue. I hope there will be higher difficulty available.FPS part is not good nor bad. AI and weapon impacts (injuries) could be better.Multiplayer is great with friends (as in other coop games), I really enjoyed concept of unlocking unique characters by playing chains for 3 stars. My biggest issue is again lack of variety and in this case also long term progression.Final words - I would give harsher review if this game is for full price. Current price is more than adequate for 8+ hours I have spent in this game.",Positive

There is a stealth mechanics but no matter what you do, it ends like a shootout. Playing campaign with dumb bots as your teammates is really painful. AI of the enemies is really bad. It feels like youre shooting some zombies with guns. Gunplay itself is otherwise ok.Even in multiplayer, you play CO-OP against these dumb AI enemies, which is not very entertaining. I dont understand why cant you play story campaign in CO-OP. This is just lazy.Rogue-like mechanics in the single player mode is supposed to be one the selling points of this game. Problem is, the missions are so repetetive, you probably wouldnt want to play this game over and over again.Story, cinematics, voice acting is extremly bad.  Such a waste, with cast like this.

3178,crime-boss-rockay-city,30-Mar-23,2,"Such wasted potential. This was supposed to be that game that isn't totally great, but is a guilty pleasure like the 1990 action movies. But it's been a terrible disappointment. The actors are the main attraction, but they don't act, they recite lines that are extremely boring, with no ideas and not a shred of humor. Except for Michael Rooker who at least tried. Which is a big shame because we know that games can incorporate real actors well see Keanu Reeves, Christopher Judge etc. and it's a breath of fresh air to games. Gameplay is boring, repetitive, no fun, frustrating. In two hours you get to the same area in multiple missions, but the difference is the safe is in a different location and there are more enemies. The AI in the game just doesn't exist. You have partners who do absolutely nothing and 20 cops charging at you headlong. No tactics, no stealth gameplay (you can try, but it still usually turns into a headless gunfight) The rogue-like element is interesting, but not in this game. If you play 6-8 hours and then have to do it all over again, same lame dialogue, same missions. The idea of a 4 minute mission is interesting, but not so much when you then have to click through the menu for crap and spend another 5-10 minutes there. Then Dialogue, mission, menu and repeat over and over again. The cinematography is terrible, where you jump from actor to actor and the feeling is bad. The music is well chosen but poorly used. There is so much music in the 90's and they only pick six licensed ones. One of the few things that isn't so bad is gun play. Not excellent, but good. Maybe a couple of missions where you don't steal are mildly interesting We'll see what the developers and studio do with those problems. At the moment it's a lot worse payday, but even payday wasn't in the best shape in the very beginning and it took a while to get it to where it is today, so maybe there's hope for Crime Boss, but there's a long way to go. In current state, this game simply cannot be recommended.",Negative
3179,crime-boss-rockay-city,30-Mar-23,8,"So I just brought the game and i like it. Yes its so bad that its actually good. It has some potential to be good only if they spent more time on gameplay and not the cast. The cast is a dream but the voice acting is terrible. Especially Chuck Norris who gives the worst voice acting ever in a video game. I would have rather Steven Segal but even he would give something worst so I can deal with Chuck Norris but he's very cringe. Michael Madsen is okay but they should have gotten actual video game voice actors. I feel they could have just gotten the likeness from these people and have actually voice actors like how they did in Scarface: The World Is Yours. Just get the likeness and have better voice actors. Madsen sounds like smokey the bear smoked 30 packs of cigarettes per hour. The combat is okay but could be better. I feel that all FPS' should be like COD or Battlefield, weapons have too much recoil. I understand that guns in real life have recoil as I have shot a 9mm and 7.52x51mm rifle so I know those guns go bam. But its overexaggerated in this game. Guns are hard to control. I haven't had any bugs or glitches so far. The tutorial was very helpful as I am using a controller for this run and I'll do my KBM for my next. The permadeath is exciting and makes you be more cautions with how you move in the game. Can't go all Rambo which is good. But you lose health too quickly which isn't something I like. I feel like they could have did it like COD with no health bar and like Uncharted.  They should have made it open world and added a TPS view. There is so much potential here but they needed to at least delay the game till next year. Cast is great but they needed to spend more time on the gameplay. I do like this game so I am giving it an 8 because it does have some good things about it.",Positive

The single-player is somewhat better, but it just felt really bland and uninspired to me.",Negative
3190,crime-boss-rockay-city,30-Mar-23,7,"Although certainly rough around the edges now, Crime Boss is an otherwise interesting and fun single-player oriented take on the PAYDAY formula, offering both cooperative heists and a dedicated single-player roguelite campaign. Pros: + A full-fledged roguelite story mode revolving around taking over the Miami-inspired city, offering turf war elimination matches, heists to finance our criminal empire, and some occasional scripted story missions. The available opportunities (and muscles to hire) slightly differ with each playthrough, offering a slightly different experience for each run, even though the roguelite gameplay basics remain the same. During each run, our protagonist gains XP, unlocking new skills with each level up, making subsequent runs slightly easier to progress through by buffing our protagonist, our gang's cash flow and general strength, or the quality of equipment and muscle we can buy. + The two co-op modes are also serviceable, with Quick Play being similar to the Crime.NET screen of PAYDAY2 (offering the same heists we encounter in Story Mode in a standalone fashion), while Urban Legends being more akin to the multi-day heists of PAYDAY2 and the grand heists of GTA Online, each spanning three levels. + Some minor gameplay enhancements compared to PAYDAY2. For example, we can temporarily speed up the speed of our drills, or can unlock doors via dedicated minigames. We can also carry up to two loot bags at the same time, although in that case, we are restricted to our sidearm. + The visuals are okay, the city really conveys that 90s Florida setting pretty well. + All-around performance is also acceptable. I'm running the game on a rig with a i7-4790 CPU, a GTX 1070 VGA and 32 gigs of RAM, on a 2560x1080 ultrawide resolution, with the High detail preset. With this setting, I only experience some occasional hiccups during larger battles. + AI companions are serviceable, being able to loot the goodies independently, pick up dropped loot bags, or deliver them to the escape van on their own. We can also order them to follow us or stay put, and can seamlessly switch into them whenever needed. Granted, if we want to stealth, they may not be reliable, but they serve the single player campaign well enough. + All-around stealth is easier than it is in PAYDAY2. We have an unlimited amount of zipties and bodybags available, while guards don't wear pagers, so as long we can divert/separate them from other NPCs, it's easy to dominate and tie them up without trouble. We can also move tied NPCs around. Cons: - Writing and voice acting is horrendous. Chuck Norris' performance is probably the worst VA I've ever heard in a video game. Michael Madsen at least tries putting in a performance, but in his case, it's really off-putting to hear a 35-40 years old protagonist talking with the voice of a 65 years old guy. The game also doesn't have separate stealth and loud voice lines, meaning that you dominate guards by shouting at them (undetected) even when in stealth. - Gunplay is serviceable, but could be a lot better. You can't really ""feel"" any of the guns, and most of them feature really annoying bloom - it's hard to land shots even with semi-automatic pistols and rifles. - Lone wolfs might be bothered by the fact that even though you can play the Quick Play and Urban Legends heists solo with bots, you cannot create private lobbies. As such, if you don't fill the slots with bots, others can easily join in. Also, as I understand, the co-op game modes don't have any special rewards, you can only unlock the higher-level characters in them for story play. - Customization is only rudimentary, with each character being able to wield a two-handed weapon, a sidearm, and a special gadget (e.g. a number of throwable rocks or bricks). - Map variety is also not the game's forte, as all three game modes seemingly sharing the same combat map pool of roughly ~two dozen levels, with some minor randomization during each run (affecting guard patrols and camera placement). This, however, could change in the future. Summary: TL;DR, I like the game, and I think it worth the discounted AA price it cost during the preorder campaign, but it can certainly use some additional polish, a redesign of the rudimentary customization features, and extra robbery/heist maps. Still, if you are looking for a primarily single-player PAYDAY experience set in an over-the-top 1990s setting, you can definitely take a look at the game. :)",Average

3253,age-of-wonders-4,24-May-23,6,Age of Wonders 3 is one of my most favorite 4x games of all time.  AoW4 seems almost like a graphics update of the old game with a couple tweaks.  Paradox's weird territory system is used again.  There are some new races and some new resources but it feels like the exact same game from almost 10 years ago.

Lo siento más como una excusa por parte de malos jugadores.Por parte de issues de UI, estabilidad, y demás he encontrado muy pocos, prácticamente nada comparado con otros juegos AAA actuales.En conclusión, un excelente juego al cual ya le he dedicado horas y horas, y aún a por más!",Positive
3261,age-of-wonders-4,10-May-23,9,"I think this game will go into the books as one of the all time great fantasy 4x classics. There is sooooo much content here, it's incredible what they all managed to cram it into a 50 euro game. AoW 3 was just an ok game imo, but they improved it in all the right ways. What I like most:- insane number of different units, and via the rally of lieges mechanic you get to tailor make specific armies for beating a specific opponent- the imperium mechanic limits the number of cities you can control directly, in the old games once you took over 2 cities of an opponent you were just snowballing for the next 60 turns to inevitable victory. The city limit puts a real break on that, you still get rewarded for conquering (you'll gain vassals) though. This also cures the ""let's spam new cities everywhere"" strategy which was the optimal way to play in previous games.- the way cities grow and annex new territory is really satisfying- diplomacy is pretty well done, especially the grievances and AI personalities- I like the tome system a lot, the late game spells rightly feel extremely powerful and are a lot of fun to cast- the battle AI is not amazing but has improved a lot compared to the previous game, they keep their ranged back, try to flank and generally don't just charge headlong into your line.- the game world looks gorgeous- I cackled with joy when my evil wizard killed an opposing hero on the battlefield, then got to take his remains home and reanimate him to led my undead armies against his previous comrades. The game is full with these small flavorful touches.- since it's a paradox game, you might think you'll need the dlc's to make it enjoyable as they tend to release bare bones games, but IMO the game is already fantastic and complete as it is right now. I only saw some small animation glitches, no crashes so far. What I dislike most:- in a battle there can be so many effects in play it is hard to keep track of everything, if you want to min max everything you are going to be in the tank for a looong time- vassal ai armies should be blobbing in their city when faced with an overpowering foe, but happily march out to their doom instead- AI often doesn't clear its provinces of neutral mobs camping on province improvements- even though a lot of stuff is very well explained, it is not always obvious were a certain effect is coming from.- sea battles: when all those varied units turn into just ships ramming each other, that's a let down.",Positive

3265,age-of-wonders-4,7-May-23,8,"It is better than Age of Wonders 3, obviously. It had a rocky start in the first hours, where the Steam reviews dropped for a few hours to 40 %, because of crashes, but it is now rightfully much higher. The visuals suffer a little from typical small team issues: everything is too dark, even during the day for light factions, as if the devs had little experience in computer graphics. The shadows on the NPCs and beneath trees show the problem. The female in particular are badly lit. Small studio problems. Maybe they will fix it. But the game's pace, gameplay, are really alright. Best 4X game since Civ6. The only complaints I can think of (after 45+ h) are - The faction creator causes generic, boring races with no soul. If any race can be anything, any time, it feels... dull? Random? I read that some journalists complained about that one too, so maybe it is worth mentioning. There are no real Orcs, Elves, Skavens, or Demons in this game, if you need some. - City sieges are not fun, and make little sense. You siege an outpost for 2-3 turns, but also a big city for 5 turns? And when you beat a large army defending that city of 20 units? Nah, doesn't matter. Still waiting 3 turns. - The bad/evil standing looks nice but you notice soon that it doesn't matter. Bad and evil factions ally all the time, even after a war. Once allied, their opinion ratings increase which makes them move closer. It is a bit like the generic faction designer: it only leads to a big brown soup of randomness, unlike in other games.I also noticed how diplomacy in this game flips around like a flag in the wind. - Tactical combat at first is fun, but soon you 4-5x 6-unit-stack-armies vs another 4x 6-unit-stack-armies. Not only is map movement annoying. If they attack your tiny outpost, all you do is hoping that the siege takes 3-4 turns, so that you can move your 6-unit-stack-armies there quickly. - The world map is difficult to read. You actually want to know where your armies are, where the enemy's armies are, to plan better, but I guess the devs did not play the game themselves. The map becomes useless, unless you want to see where the borders are? - Research is confusing. After almost 50 h, I still do not understand the book choices and differences much. I could read some wiki on it. True. But come on, research should be more obvious and transparent, since picking the wrong books has a huge impact on your game. - I played multiple campaigns so far. I noticed that I do not connect or care for my factions, race, whatever. I do not read the stories. I think that it has to do with the faction designer that causes to not care about it, since any race can be anything, any time. This is contrary to Warhammer where you do care. - Another thing I noticed is the weak AI. Eventually, you have to play on super hard mode because the AI's building order and expansion are not as good as yours. But maybe that will improve soon too.",Positive

3277,the-murder-of-sonic-the-hedgehog,10-May-23,5,"This game is a pretty decent example of how a visual novel should be done. Video game developers making visual novels isn't really a problem, it's the fact that greedy developers have the audacity to charge outrageous prices for visual novels. Nintendo and Microsoft would have easily charged $15-20 for this game, not to mention that Microsoft would be bragging about this being ""free"" day 1 on Game Pass. This game is actually free, exactly as it should be. One thing the developers got right with this visual novel is actually including gameplay. I don't care what stupid buzzwords those artsy-fartsy developers like to throw around. In the end of the day, it's a video game and I appreciate that these developers remember that. Although the gameplay is basic, with retro-style running sections where you collect rings and avoid obstacles. It gets repetitive, but it wasn't long enough to bore me to death. The story was well written with interesting dialogue. There is no multiplayer but I didn't pay for this, so I don't care. It's hard to complain about a game that's completely free with no microtransactions or ads. I can't really expect much from these developers, but nothing about this game is biblical. If someone told me this was a fan-made game, I would've believed it. If the developers had included something like voice acting, then it would help differentiate this from a fan-made game. Instead the developers wasted money on this lazily composed soundtrack. Half of it sounds like it was taken straight from a Kraftwerk album, while the other half sounds like it was randomly selected from a stock music library.

3300,the-murder-of-sonic-the-hedgehog,6-Apr-23,7,"The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog is a cutsey visual novel/runner. You play as (Insert Name Here), a sonic OC who works on a train. The train is hosting a murder mystery game for Amy Rose for her birthday. Everyone was given a role, and someone is to “murder” Sonic and then try to hide the evidence, creating a whodunit. This is a rather silly game that has a few plot twists to it. It’s very straightforward, having no real meaningful choices, but it is cutsey nonetheless. The Sonic cast is presented well and in a humorous manner, the visual novel plot is okay, there’s silly little runner minigames to “figure things out”, and… well, that’s about it. If you’re a Sonic fan, chances are good you’ll find the way that the game plays around with characters to be fun, and enjoy the silly plot and character shenanigans. They are pretty true to their typical characterizations, but it all works well enough, and there’s enough little plot twists to keep the game interesting. The art is actually pretty nice as well – the characters have limited poses, but they look good, as do the environments. If you’re not a Sonic fan, though, I’m skeptical you’ll enjoy it as much; it is full of meta-references to Sonic stuff, with little in the way of explanations. Overall, decent but not amazing, but it costs nothing and is cute.",Average
3301,the-murder-of-sonic-the-hedgehog,6-Apr-23,10,"Absolutely fantastic, and one of the best Sonic experiences I've ever had! The story is very well written, funny, heartwarming, and the characterization for everyone, especially Shadow and Espio is on point, and its the best they've ever been. The music is great, which is to be expected of a Sonic game, and the art and presentation feels like it came right out of the IDW Sonic comics. Gameplay wise the game is a solid challenge, and for those that find it a bit too hard there are accessibility options to tailor the experience more to your liking. I hope this game's universal success shows Sega just how much we love these characters, and why we love them so much. Also I love Eggman and his four kids, long live the Egg Family! The game is also free to go along with it high quality, so it's a very easy recommend. If you're a Sonic Fan you'll love it, and if you aren't one, the game will show you why so many care about the story of Sonic so much. Hopefully we get more Sonic visual novels, and the next 3-D game goes for a more comic like cel-shaded visual style.",Positive

I really enjoyed all the characters together, interacting with each other like any other normal day, it fills my heart with joy, since one of my favorite parts of the sonic franchise is the characters. Also, their clothing and personalities according to their 'lore', god it was amazing. I absolutely fell in love with the art style, props to the team:). This new style of game is really nice as well, I never thought I'd be playing Sonic in a visual novel style, but here we are! How we had the ability to choose between options only made the game even more interesting! The story was nice, it kept me interested until the end and had some moments that got me excited, it was really creative! I had a good laugh with this game, indeed. The music was enjoyable and creative, the way that it really sets an ambient and still matches with the game and its theme got me satisfied. The mini-game was fun too, it got challenging at one point, which only made it even more enjoyable.

3315,the-murder-of-sonic-the-hedgehog,3-Apr-23,10,"I already was familiar with the genre of graphic novel games, so the change of gameplay from the typical platformer to graphic novel wasn't that hard for me. With the huge cast of characters the Sonic franchise has, a storybased game like a graphic novel is a good idea.It was a simple game. It's not too complicated. It is an easy graphic novel game with mostly point and click gameplay.You are playing as a new character, who is helping (mostly) Tails to figure out a crime. There is however also a lot of interaction with other characters. The game does have some twists, which is nice. Your character is clearly an ordinary citizen, who is sometimes bringing a contrast to the more over the top characters Sonic and his friends are. The character also sometimes calls out the crazy antics, which are normal by the standard of the main cast. There are also some interactions with main cast members who didn't interact a lot in the past, and they play off each other rather nicely.There are platforming segments/special stages, mostly used for when your character tries to come up with an idea.The game was mostly marketed as an April Fool's joke. With the trailer making fun of the criticism Sega endured over the years and the good news they listened and Sonic is now dead. But Sega went the extra mile by approving and publishing the game, which again, does have a good story. It is a fun game. It is somewhat short with a gameplay of around 2-3 hours, but for a free game this is surely not bad.A good game and a good marketing move from Sega. I hope we'll get another graphic novel game in the future. Perhaps with some characters who missed this adventure.",Positive

Ended up really enjoying it, the style was far point point-and-click adventure than visual novel and you're essentially just solving puzzles and unraveling the mystery.  However, these point-and-click chapters are broken up by 2d (on an axis) Sonic mini-games that can get extremely challenging, where you must collect a certain number of rings whilst avoiding a magnitude of obstacles and threats under the guise of the main character thinking and constructing an inspection.  I found some of these very tough but manageable, however, the final boss fight and one other towards the end were extremely tough, much more so than any of the others and could've been dialed down a bit (although sonic games often have insanely hard final battles so it's not out of character). This was a solid game and could've easily sold for money, it being free is a very welcome surprise, and its April Fool's release date shouldn't put anyone off playing it in the thought that it's not a legitimate game.

Love how every single mercenary has his own strong personality, voice acting, unique in game lines and in game model (i like decision that you don't see donned armor, because you will just have same looking 6 grey figures on map in that case). Characters have hilarious reactions, every single NPC has great written personality and voice acting. Every NPC is unique and by far from tedious. Humor is raw, challenging every ""be correct"" topic of this decade but is not offensive and I love it. Only thing from giving it 10 out of 10 is combat and some in game balance. Some weapon types and game mechanics (mercenary training) are totally OP, others are practically useless compared to their counterparts. First 1/3 to half of the game is fun challenge, but after that you became so powerful, that even on highest difficulty you just wipe floor with everyone, hardly taking any damage.

3345,jagged-alliance-3,20-Jul-23,8,"It took 24 years, but someone finally made a good Jagged Alliance sequel. THQ took the safe - and sane - approach and did not try to change, what worked. As always, you are getting your AIM mercs together, to boot some evil guy from a made-up country in the name of it's rightful ruler. You take cities, mines, and enhance your mercs - this time more directly, than before, as you will hit level-ups, and can choose from a set of skills, based on the corresponding attributes of your merc.Big change in gameplay: this is closer to Wastelands 2 and 3, than JA2 - there are so many sidequests, and optional missions, where you have to gather or find stuff, and deliver them to certain characters, you can drown in them if you want. Attributes and perks guide everything, and most quests are tide to one of them: sometimes you need wisdom, or medical skills, to finish a quest. If you don't meet the required level, you will not be able to get the reward.The majority of the old mercs are back - from AIM, anyway, and those, who were cut, like Buzz, or Rothman, are replaced with new guys - or some returning, old ones, like Mouse. All established relationships remain as always, so Raven and Raider are still an item, Fox is still dating... everyone, but mostly Wolf and so on. This is where the game shines: the banter is back, and it works. It was good, hearing Grizzly and Shadow, or Igor and Grunty talk. They are funny, charming and they do deliver, what was missing from all other attempts of a sequel.Even the voiceovers are very decent! Sometimes, I could swear, they got the original actress or actor back. Great work!The legendary 1.13 arsenal, however, is gone. This is much closer to JA2 vanilla levels - without the 'tons-o-guns' options! That was a shame, but I learned to live with it.The game is now full 3d, rotatable, and all the rest. It looked good enough, but it does not push the envelope, that is for sure. Does it have to? I don't think so - if it delivers on the gameplay, I am happy.So did it?Yeah. Mostly, it did.Enemies are challenging, but I got a bit tired at the end, of all the same encounters. Some enemies are overpowered, some levels are pushing it. If you remember 1.13 siege of Meduna, with those neverending 60+ elite guards battles, well, brace yourself. I had some issues with how unforgiving the skill-check system is: you can manage the game with a medic, who has 72 points in her attribute - but if a skill check requires 75+, you will never meet that level. You will have to hire an expert just for that specific task. That results in the in-between guys having less value, than the high-end specialists. Why bother with Wolf, and his 67 points in medicine and mechanics, if he will never be able to disarm a mine, that need 70+, or heal someone, who needs 85+, to pass? I also got tired with some of the fetch-quests, like finding 12 chairs, of going to 5 different locations, to collect virus samples, erecting effigies 9 times in the jungle. Those were more bother, than what they worth, but they were all optionals, thank God. That being said: I had a fun time with the game. It's not perfect, but it is still good. 8/10",Positive

I'll not list the pro and con because that is subjective to individual. Just trying to share my opinion on the game. I do see a lot of people is referencing this game to X-com. There is only a small element of X-com in this game. example triggering the enemy group and giving them the time to move into cover while not being able to react. But what X-com gave is every character somehow felt similar and is differentiate by class. In JA3, it has that individual character that is more unique and having a positive and negative traits.

While managing to hold on to the depth of gameplay the franchise is known for, it still does a great job of introducing new players to its many systems and nuances, and the over-the-top writing is difficult to not enjoy. The RPG and management aspects work quite well with the minute-to-minute combat gameplay to make Jagged Alliance 3 an incredibly unique title, with maybe BattleTech and Phantom Brigade being the only other similar options. If playing a turn-based take on classic action movies, complete with the silliness in terms of writing and characters that the genre is known for appeals to you, Jagged Alliance 3 is definitely something you want to check out.",Positive

3362,darkest-dungeon-ii,7-Jul-23,0,One of the worst games with so many annoying mechanics in 2023. By far to overpriced and has nothing to do with Darkest Dungeon 1. Had to refund that .......,Negative
3363,darkest-dungeon-ii,21-Jun-23,8,"After seven or eight years, the long awaited sequel to the critically acclaimed Darkest Dungeon has finally arrived and a lot has changed. There is a lot to love about this game but there is also a lot to hate/dislike, perhaps I am just writing this in the heat of the moment but as the game stands and as for what happened to me personally, I cannot say I recommend it. The gameplay has changed dramatically, this is both a good thing and a bad thing.The game plays as follows: You select a confession (This is basically difficulty level) and then select four heroes with different skillsets to venture forth through different zones in order to get to the mountain where a boss lies in wait for you to defeat or die to.The core gameplay loop lies in that each time you succeed or fail, you get candles to upgrade your characters and unlock items which are now permanently in the game, this is what makes the game very rogue-like. As opposed to the original where you would be playing a 50-60 hour long campaign with nearly 30 heroes, you'll be stuck with four for the entire run. This isn't a bad thing as the best part about this way of doing things is that you get to play around with comps a lot and see what works and what doesn't. Combat has sort of been overhauled. What I will say is, combat feels so much more RNG than the original and a lot of damage feels very out of your control in this one. Instead of accuracy vs dodge stats, it's been simplified to ""50% chance to hit"" with blindness, or they can mititgate 50-75% of damage instead, etc.The only good thing to come out of this is that you know when you'll hit, there is no random chance to just miss like in the first one, if you're clean of debuffs and they're clean of buffs, you'll hit every time but the damage is still at the mercy of the dice. Some of the most satisfying parts of Darkest Dungeon 2 is when you find that comp that has a lot of synergy. Buffing and debuffing to set up for big hits or a lot of heals and dot damage, once you find a comp that works for you, you'll begin to enjoy the game a lot. My biggest criticisms is that at the end of each zone there's a thing called a ""Rampart"" which is basically cultist type enemies. These things are absolutely horrific to deal with. They are completely and utterly no fun at all. They hit way too hard, buff themselves into next week and it feels like they always crit. All enemies feel like they crit you more than you crit them. Some enemies get two turns per round, sometimes even three, and that's fine. But there are some enemies, specifically cultist types and buffing enemies, that have no indication that they get two moves a round, but they do anyway? Why is this? It happens randomly with no rhyme or reason behind it. If they get two moves, that's fine, give them two indicators, don't just randomly have two moves on what should only be one turn. Makes no sense. Some of the bosses just seem way too hard, I'm lucky enough to come from the experience of pouring a lot of hours into the first one but some of the mechanics are just wild. Randomly critting the entire party each turn with no point in mitigating cause the damage is well into the 80s. The biggest downside to me is that when you fail a run, despite getting candles; because you've been absolutely hammered by overtuned mobs and RNG, is how much time you feel like you've wasted. Even if you full party wiped in the first game, yeah you lost some good characters, but you didn't feel like your time was wasted, at least, not four hours worth per run, I think that's what makes the game so frustrating for me. The game is meant to be about making the best out of a bad situation, which you absolutely do, but it feels like you have so much less control over what to do in the bad situation in this game than you do in the first one. There's so many little niggling issues with this game, like the inability to sell trinkets, even just for one coin a go, instead of just discarding them. When someone dies and you reach an inn, you get a random adventurer joining your party, why can't I select the one that fits best with my party? Do I really need another full tank, or another squishy healer after my tank has been killed? However, after almost losing my save due to a power cut, when all hope was lost, when my stress was 10/10 and having a Meltdown for three days, I reinstalled the game and managed to fix and recover my save, allowing myself to start a run without restarting the whole game, a truly virtuous and ""Resolute"" for myself. Darkest Dungeon 2 has a few problems, there's no doubt about that, some balancing needs to be done, some characters probably need a little nerf and some definitely need a buff. I look forward to seeing what the developers are going to do going forth, they've already announced some of the extra content we can look forward to, like the Collector and Origin Skins for the characters.",Positive

Unfortunately, it's supposed to be the sequel to darkest except that it's lost the essence of what made it darkest dungeon. It's a good rogue lite (even if it doesn't shine in terms of mechanics, content or originality) but a bad darkest dungeon. Oh and I was going to forget: no support for wide screen in 2023 whereas it was the case for darkest 1... that, I did not expect and it's a good big ****No sense of attachment to the characters so no sense of loss when everyone dies Very little sense of progression between runs, as you don't get to keep your trinkets and you always leave with a bunch of rubbish. And overall very little sense of progression or power gain between runs. No sense of attachment to the hamlet and no strategic aspect that requires you to focus on certain resources. Everything has been replaced by candles, and the 'hamlet' has no soul... it's just there for you to earn bonuses and so on, but you have no interaction with it. Riding in a cart... it's a pain in the arse and, even if it had to be done, it would have been even better to do it just like slay the spire without having to go all the way in a cart... The battles themselves were more strategic, but less so overall. You can no longer compose a team according to the biome or to kill a specific boss, so some very strong compositions in one biome become almost useless in another... you can compose with the path choices, but that's it. Fewer classes than in Darkest 1. This will probably come later, but right now the roster is far too small... add to that the difficulty of balancing classes and the fact that some classes are almost essential, and you end up with a lack of freedom in team composition... The loss of the feeling of 'stress' during a run... you know that feeling of stress when you're walking down a corridor wondering if you're going to get trapped, attacked, ... when your guys are almost dead? The fear of opening the door too many times during a run and having your whole team die (even though you'd finished the dungeon but stayed to pick up a few loots) The interaction with the different elements of the scenery that gave buffs or malus? I could go on and on but I'll stop here. Well, all that stuff, you make a big ball of it and throw it in a bin because it's disappeared from darkest dungeon 2. I really like the animations and the new graphics, the new combat mechanics, ... but that's about it. What's more, the relationship system is currently pretty poorly done and is often more distracting than anything else, even if the basic idea was good (the system during the beta could have used some polishing rather than making this relationship-based skill system). Finally, a rogue mechanic 'cheat sheet In summary, if you're looking for a rogue lite, get it. If you're looking for the darkest dungeon sequel, don't get your hopes up. My rating does not really represent the quality of the game (as I mentioned, the game itself is worth 7 or 8/10) BUT this rating expresses all my disappointment with this Darkest dungeon 2 that I was waiting for with great enthusiasm. hope (and fear for playing all of Early Access).

It's disheartening to invest hours into a run only to have it abruptly end because one character randomly falls ill. While the concept of starting over isn't necessarily bad, it becomes meaningless when character development offers such meager benefits. The repetition of dungeons, especially by the third act, feels monotonous. It begs the question, is this normal? In the first darkest dungeon, there was the freedom to choose, but now that choice is gone, replaced by the same repetitive gameplay. Who designed it this way? The minimal progression system resembles that of a mobile game, where negative emotions are used to exploit addictive tendencies, but here it falls flat. I'm not sure what you were trying to achieve, but I must admit the graphics, music, and narrator are great. However, the overall experience feels shallow because the accompanying frustration outweighs everything else. A game should be difficult and challenging, but it should also provide a sense of progress, which is sorely lacking here. Moreover, the fact that each expedition begins and ends in the exact same way, with annoying abyss enemies, is incredibly tiresome. Why aren't there multiple endings for expeditions? Why does it always conclude in the same manner? I find it hard to believe that you didn't have the resources or expertise for a more developed and analyzed game.

That's it really.It's just a very poor roguelike, where as the runs progress we improve our characters, the diligence, etc. Even during runs for the choice of paths, you sometimes have to choose between the story of a character or a positive point of interest for example.

Some enemies feel like they need more tuning, especially when Ordained. Story starts interesting but grinds to a halt due to being drip-fed over runs. Lacks some of the original's charm. Thoughts-Overall, I feel like Darkest Dungeon 2 works well, though I’d appreciate some node variety and finer tuning of some enemies.

Not slow, trudging, boring, tedious, eyerolling, watch tapping, quagmire loving mental molasses.There is a decent game underneath all this garbage but it's simply not worth your time to access. The worst thing about it is that it would have been so easy for them to remove the padding and make a snappy roguelike, after YEARS of playtesting, but clearly someone on the production team is too attached to the stagecoach as a concept, and wouldn't let it go. Then group think set in and it was accepted despite them having a deep seeded concern at how slow and boring it is. Don't fight the urge.. just get rid of the stupid thing. The sink loss fallacy...

3395,darkest-dungeon-ii,11-May-23,10,"Darkest Dungeon 2 expands much on its previous iteration while also adding a bunch of new unique systems. The biggest thing veteran players will notice is that the combat and stress systems have been overhauled and reworked to be much more refreshing and much less RNG focused (there is still some, kind of needed honestly). On top of the fact that the art, animation, and sound design have been overhauled to the extreme and feel fantastic. Your actions, buffs, and debuffs will have much more impact than raising your blight resistance by 10% or lowering an enemies accuracy by 10%. The new buffs and debuffs work off a hit system rather than turns. Your dodge and improved dodge increase your dodge to the next hit by 50% and 75% respectively; same goes for protection buffs. They can stack up to 2 or 3, but no further. This puts you in a more turn to turn strategy than was the preplanning fest of Darkest Dungeon 1. There is still some pre-planning for party comp and first round turns, but that is where it stops more or less. Red Hook has also added a new relationship system that builds off of character interaction in fights and in taverns. Theses relationship can be positive or negative but they heavily impact your teams fighting capabilities. While one bad relationship is not game losing by any means, having two or three negative relationships between characters WILL lose you the run. I highly recommend focusing on this aspect and learning it. It is relatively simple to understand and will take your gameplay to a whole new level once mastered. The voiceover by Wayne June, Music, and Sound Design are once again masterful and are absolutely my favorite part of DD2. They set a tone early on of YOU being the last hope. And the character in your party seeking atonement. It speaks to me a lot as a gamer, and even more so as a person. I highly recommend you pick the game up if you have never played Darkest Dungeon 1. I will note that the game is difficult and you will lose A LOT before you get the hang of it, but you will have fun doing it. Those that like Darkest Dungeon 1 will be comfortable but have more to master and I recommend the game even more to those people. There are more systems and tweaks that I have not touched on here. I assure you they are all for the better and tie the gameplay and theme together quite nicely. I will leave you to play and find those particular changes out yourself.

They cut out all of the town building, character building, and trinket accumulating aspects of the first game. They added a carriage that is horrible to control and a relationship system that either makes your team hate each other internally for no reason or literally turns your characters gay for each other whether you want them to or not. They simplified the stats with tokens which keeps an element of RNG but makes it now much less interesting and nuanced than before. They cut out the ancestor's dark tales of macabre investigations into the occult.

It didn't hold over its side-scrolling nature of travelling through dungeons, nor its management of many characters. The city where we used to find new heroes is a thing of the past. We're travelling in a stagecoach with 4 heroes, moving to the left and right and we get to choose 1 of 3 paths. Stagecoach can seem unresponsive but turning speed can be increased. We're getting some extra loot from hitting objects on the road sometimes. Some paths are slightly more dangerous and there are even watchtowers which reveal the rest of what's ahead. There are mission objectives that give us rewards after fulfilling these simple tasks that can be failed very easily by choosing the wrong paths or not fighting enough enemies. At the end of each run there's an inn where our heroes rest, buy consumables only used here, combat consumables which are free actions during hero combat turns and we can upgrade skills, each skill only once. Here, we can also buy trinkets, which are hero equipment boosts, and stagecoach upgrades which provide us with more slots or stacks in inventory. We can not sell anything in the whole game which may sound like a bummer but we're gaining Torchlight after discarding items. Torchlight is still crucial and works similarly to what we've known already, when lit to full, provides the heroes with minor buffs but when poorly lit, it's the other way around. There are events on the road where I get to decide what my character does, influencing the relationships. Sometimes two characters want pretty much the same thing but only some hero will react to that positively, it is a bit of role playing here, some like each other naturally. Negative relationships also affect which abilities worsen it, so occasionally, you are forced to play outside of your comfort abilities. Another novelty here is a focus on narrating hero stories. They were just fodder in the previous game. Here, they seem more important. Once we choose the hero in the shrine, the narrator tells us a little bit of their backstory. We either get a new free skill or we need to win a mini combat to get it. Sometimes after winning a combat, the game offers us to fight the second and then another ""round"" for even better loot. There's a loathing system which increases the strength of enemies and affects the Torchlight. The more fights we attend, the lower it goes so it's better to fight early against weaker enemies. Finally, there is also a new type of burning enemies. We also get a new hero with burning skills. We can still use stuns but more often than that we'll daze enemies instead, which changes their speed to the lowest for that turn Some enemy types, especially bosses will sometimes hang on the Death's Door, like heroes usually do when they reach 0. Characters also lose any debuffs, dots and replenish some HP with stress after combat. I've had my number 1 frontliner on death's door most of the time so he eventually died because his relationships were all negative and despite him having the biggest HP pool, he tanked the most damage and stress. Heroes also receive quirks which I can cure or lock the good ones. It's only happening on the road when reaching ""ward stations"". Here I can also replenish the HP and buy some items. Game is very good at explaining all its features. Not only is the tutorial extensive, I can come back to it from the main menu, and I can also hold ALT and G for icons. We can prepare before combat. The combat is either a barricade on the road or inside a building and there's really no way we can walk around it or go back. When I enter a building, I can choose to escape and I have failed only once in my last fight. I spent 8 hours on my first run and almost reached the final destination. After that the game evaluated my hope, I jumped from level 1 to 6, unlocked two heroes and many more items and quirks. There are a total of 50 profile levels to unlock which could possibly result in 80 hours of gametime. It's way too different from the first one, only the characters, their skills and atmosphere remain the same. There's no hometown to come back to but inns on the road while travelling. It's also got simpler micro management and focuses more on relationships between 4 heroes. It's slow paced but less epic, and I would say it will find a niche audience as a prequel as it is slightly more story oriented and less repetitive. I find more diverse enemies and still many fights and even more boss fights with similar combat mechanics to Darkest Dungeon 1",Positive
3400,darkest-dungeon-ii,10-May-23,10,"Review bombers are sub-human trash.The game is different, but it's also fantastic. DD1 isn't going anywhere, now we have 2 different games with different styles that both live up to top quality turn based combat. Thank you RedHook!",Positive
3401,darkest-dungeon-ii,10-May-23,5,"It's embarrassing user reviews are always 0 or 10. I played few a few hours but overall this is a downgrade from DD1 in a lot of ways. It ditches the metaprogression in base building for one off runs, which I don't hate on paper. The first game became a slog of a grind and that needed fixing. But roguelites based around short runs are only good when there's a ton of variability between those runs in that no two feel the same. This is not the case here, it's just the same combat from the first game slightly tweaked with the same characters. You unlock new things for future runs sure, but nothing that's going to change the experience. It's a major disappointment.",Average

You even have to grind for the fast travel that you unlock pretty late into the game. I ended up never using it at all. Don't listen to anyone who compares this game to Freelancer. They are nothing alike. Everspace 2 has next to no redeeming qualities. Maybe the story? EDIT: finished the game, the story is anything but okay.

The core gameplay is a mixture of intense space combat and relaxed container puzzles and that combination works really well. It's a real pleasure to maneuver your ship through tight spaces. But at the fringes the game shows it's only a double-A title. Especially the trading and faction mechanics are very shallow. The way the story is rushed to the end, how repetetive encounters can become, how similar all of the loot is and how rarely legendaries drop really made me just want to finish it off. You get to open Diablo-inspired rifts, but only after the story is done, at which point I did not really care anymore.

Loot repeats over and over again, you will use the same weapons all game just with higher stats, legendary items are too rare for a looter shooter. Quests are level gated, meaning you have to grind the same boring enemies and missions to advance. Now the worst part must be the puzzles that repeat over and over again. It is like finding a needle in a haystack, absolutely sleep inducing! It took me 25 hours to complete the game and I just soldiered through because I hoped it would get better.

3422,everspace-2,9-Apr-23,9,"Took me minute to get the controls adjusted (i.e. mouse movement speed, dead zone), but once I did, flying felt amazing.  Navigating around can sometimes be a little disorientating, but that's not a shortcoming of the game.  Instead, it's a side effect of being able to move and rotate any which way you want.  Fortunately, hud icons marking enemies/items/points-of-interest help. Combat is also great.  Different weapons feel distinct, and are good for different situations (i.e. close or long range combat).  Can also equip your ships with additional active abilities, which are sure to suit different play styles.  Can modulate difficulty through a difficulty slider, aim-assist slider, and through doing some extra grinding. RPG mechanics are limited solely to progression.  So, don't expect choice when it comes to dialogue or solving quests.  There are, however, several different ways to progress (i.e. ships, equipment, companion perks, main character perks, upgrading active abilities). The main gameplay loop involves traveling somewhere for a mission, killing enemies, completing the quest, and then exploring around for all the goodies that are scattered about.  There are also light puzzle elements tied to accessing some of the loot (i.e. destroying shield generators to get past a shield, or providing power to a doohicky so that doors will open). Nothing particularly intriguing or compelling when it comes to story, dialogue, and characters, but it's serviceable.  The voice acting is solid though. Haven't beat the game yet, but I wouldn't be surprised if I hit 100 hours of play time before seeing the credits roll. Oh, do note that it's not a true open world.  It has ""lily pads,"" and what is essentially an immersive world map.  Like, instead of just selecting areas on a world map to travel to, or walking an avatar across a world map, you're transitioned to a 3d world map, that is graphically indistinguishable from the lily pads, that you can fly around in.  It's a neat trick, which was executed well.  (Hopefully that all made sense). No lootboxes or other microtransaction BS. I have quibbles with certain things (like mining with guns, and the sound effects that accompany it), but none of that is getting in the way of my fun.  It's a good game, and I definitely recommend it for guys who like space combat, exploration, and progression systems.",Positive

Ideas of different horrors of life such as diseases, war etc as a departments in some organisation of Death is pretty cool.Welp, that's it.Bad sides:1. Plot wise, they tried to make it somewhat like Hades, but in Hades we had different famous greek gods and good voice acting. Here we have mumbling instead of voice acting (budget issue, whatever) and absolutely boring dialogs with pathetic attempts of humor with some meta-jokes. I tried to read it, but it's just not interesting, but plot isn't what we come for in this games, right?2. Gameplay wise this game is just a complete rip off of Dead Cells but ... worse. And ok, devs copied 3 colour progression, unlocking weapons in a shop and many many more things. But they completely messed up healing system. Remember rally effect in dead cells (healing if you attack after getting hit). Here they made some INnOVaTiOnS. Rally effect is no more, but if you keep getting hit, there's a grey zone on your healthbar, which gets smaller after receiving more damage and allows you to heal only that grey zone. Meaning your maximum health isn't really your max health, but a useless thing, because only grey zone matters. And there's SO FEW healing in this game. You can sometimes abuse it (with certain skills giving hp spheres over time and with other few things), but blue healing spheres are really rare to find. But don't worry, devs have thought about how to fix their new stupid system! You can get your ACTUAL max hp back using yellow hp spheres. Buuuut, it can be found once in millenia, or be combined from a 3+ blue spheres (which you must keep not using and collect enough), so don't really get your hopes up.Also, remember Dead Cells gave you ability to fully heal your hp and estus flask between levels on first difficulty, so you could learn the game and enemy movelist? Forget about it, as i understood we have 11 boss stem cell difficulties (complete rip off but whatever, good mechanic) and even on the first difficulty YOU CANNOT HEAL BETWEEN LEVELS WOW. So you can survive boss on 1 hp and get to next level totally with 0 resources (on a level you visit for the first time). Great idea. In short, idea of combining Dead Cells gameplay and Hades approach for a plot in an interesting setting of Death is cool, but what came out in the end is just really bad. Don't buy this, it's better if you play these 2 games instead of Have a Nice Death. Seems like developers just didn't have enough experience to make this game work properly.",Negative

It also throws mundane skirmish missions at you over and over to pad the time. Simply put its an unfun slog. Multiplayer is a complete mess, you cant even zoom out enough to see what going on properly and they will buff and nerf factions on a weekly basis making them unplayable for a time instead of fixing the games many, MANY issues.

3465,company-of-heroes-3,6-Mar-23,0,"Company of Heroes 3 is a game that fails to live up to its predecessors in every possible way. The developers seem to have abandoned any semblance of quality control in favor of rushing the game to market as quickly as possible, resulting in a mess of a product that is both frustrating and unfulfilling to play. The graphics, while technically impressive, suffer from a lack of polish and artistry that makes them feel flat and lifeless. The character models are poorly animated and devoid of personality. The environments are equally uninspired, lacking the attention to detail and visual interest that made the previous Company of Heroes games so immersive. The gameplay is similarly lackluster, plagued by glitches and bugs that make it feel like a half-baked prototype rather than a fully-realized game. The controls are unresponsive and clunky, leading to frustrating moments of misclicks and mistakes. The AI is similarly poor, making questionable decisions and failing to offer meaningful challenges. The sound design is equally disappointing, with repetitive sound effects and a forgettable score that fails to add an authentic atmosphere or emotion to the game. The voice acting is similarly weak, with flat performances that make the dialogue feel stilted and awkward. Overall, Company of Heroes 3 is a game that fails to deliver on every front. It's a lackluster effort that feels rushed and unfinished, and it's difficult to recommend it to anyone. If you're a fan of the series, you may find some enjoyment in the game, but for everyone else, it's best to steer clear and find a more fulfilling gaming experience elsewhere.",Negative

They've written an entire blog post with everything that the game will have and not have at launch Conclusion:- if you wanna play the campaigns, go for the game, it is pretty fun- if you wanna have fun with the gameplay, go for it, as there are a lot of broken tactics because the game is new, ofc it won't be very balanced- if you just wanna play ranked and tryhard, I suggest you to wait as there are no replays (just a work around for them), no real  ranked system and so on at launch, but those will be added soon. I personally can't understand why people are hating so much. The game has a solid foundation and for real, even CoH1 had so many bugs and problems at the beginning (the matchmaking was trash,  the people would remove you from lobbies 24/7 because you just started playing or because you have low rank, the community was toxic af and so on) and I remember this because I've played a lot of CoH1 when I as between 11 and 14 years old.",Average

Saving bugs are just one key failure of this game. Think it has crashed 10 times in the last two days. Three-four times just trying to get it to save post Monte-Cassino to progress the game. The skirmish filler missions are too repetitive, it becomes dull. The campaign map's missions often lack clarity. The Partisan support to capture doesn't ever seem like it works. In mission statuses don't update or During missions units get stuck and can't move. Unit's actions don't work. There isn't enough feedback to the user that a unit or off-map support action has just been activated - it still looks like it can be clicked.The graphics look the same as the previous games (like 10years ago) If you get loyalty for one of the generals they give you automatic naval units which clog up unit supply on the campaign map until you discover the salvage action. Until that discover it makes it difficult to complete limited-turn/timed campaign missions. The Germans don't seem to use bombers in Italian campaign mode so there's no point building anti-air encampments or fighters for that matter. Actually there doesn't seem to be much point building any of the encampments. Most of the missions are finishing before getting to use the top-tier units or the unit cap for the map is already full.

Even the supposed good reviews are littered with references to an unfinished game or poor graphics. Relic really do seem to be deaf to the voices of the game's community - all of these issues had been pointed out in Pre Alpha testing and none of it had been fixed. Relic could have simply added new content for the existing CoH2 game - new units, armies, theatres, quality of life enhancements - and it would have been much better than this half baked attempt at a new game. There are mods out there, developed by the community for free, that are better than CoH3!!! Think about that - a group of paid professionals could not out perform some fan boys doing a bit of game dev in their spare time, for free. Fundamentally i'd say there are 2 things wrong with Relic: one, the original team is long gone and no one who works there has a clue how to put this thing together, and two they are not passionate about RTS games - they simply don't understand what makes these games enjoyable and there focus is on bells & whistles the community doesn't care for while neglecting core elements of the game! The community and the game's IP would be better served under the direction of someone who ""gets it"" - file Company of Heroes 3 under failed RTS games- beside C&C: Red Alert 3!",Negative

3503,remnant-ii,2-Aug-23,4,"Remnant 2 is possibly the most overrated game of the year. Nearly every review is positive for some reason. The story is so bad. It boils down to girl goes missing - search for girl - find girl - girl wants to save the world - girl (who does nothing) - makes you save the world. Gameplay: Gunplay is easily the best part of the game even though it's truly average at best. That's all I have to say about it. You shoot things. World Design: Randomized floor plans are barely random. Imo, not a single area is really worth replaying. Every world is bland and small. Nothing wowed me with world design. Class System: The majority of classes that can be obtained will be obtained pretty late into the game. By this point, you most likely won't level your subclass by the time you finish the campaign. With the bad world design that isn't very repayable, you won't use that class to its full potential basically ever. Customization: There are not a lot of armor options in the game. Actually obtaining these armor pieces requires following a 40 step guide in order to find it. Weapons: Not a single weapon felt very fun or interesting to me or my friends that I played with. Boss Design: The boss design is passable but you aren't going to be too impressed. Difficulty: The game isn't very hard. For majority of boss fights, I was able to solo and first try them. The boss fights that were hard threw infinite spawns of ads at you while you tried to fight the actual boss. Overall: Every single aspect of the game was either generic (enemy design, weapons, armor, worlds, bosses) or lacking in some degree. I genuinely think this game deserves a 4/10 MAX in comparison to the Souls games which this game is directly choosing to compete with, it truly fails on every single thing it tries to do.",Negative
3504,remnant-ii,2-Aug-23,3,"The game runs at such a low resolution that it looks blurry on consoles and pcs. Resolution is a very important part of the quality of the graphics, and having to drop the base rendering resolution to 720p on pc and consoles as well ruins all the work that the artists have done on this game (on Xbox Series S it drops the resolution even further). Worst game optimizacion I've ever seen. Online functions need more work as it is frustrating to get into a game and never get revived, or getting kicked as soon as joining a game. Netcode has issues as well. The rest of the game is fine but nothing special or extraordinary, there are better implementations of every noteworthy feature of this game in other games. I would have given this game a score of 6 or 7 if it didn't have the issues described above. I think the game is fine for console peasants, but it is not good enough for pc gaming standards.",Negative

3507,remnant-ii,1-Aug-23,8,"A Souls like game is what I can say. Whenever you restart a campaign you get new ""side"" scenarios in order to push the main story. Lots of hidden items/ classes if you don't google. A very clever yet efficient way (in terms of resources) to keep your players playing the game. This game also embarrasses most AAA companies IMO. I am looking at your Blizzard. Not to mention the game is cheap.The game does have it's downsides such as a bit outdated graphics or some annoying bugs that need to be fixed soon.

3508,remnant-ii,1-Aug-23,6,"The game is alright. The core gunplay is really good and fun, as well as the boss fights. However, the story is practically nonexistent to the point where there is no motivation to go on whatsoever. More often than not you are going to find yourself aimlessly wandering around the map searching for the one path that leads to your destination. Some say that in this way the game forces you to explore its world, but there is not much to discover after all. All you will find, is some generic post-apocalyptic mess covered with slightly above-average textures. Like yes, it all looks fine, yet remembering this game was developed with Unreal engine 5 leaves you decently disappointed. Overall, it consists of the typical Souls formula: You are passing through lots of minor and large dungeons while exploring, killing enemies left and right with a very solid combat system and earning more and more of the worlds lore with each boss you „fell“. If that is enough for you, go have a good time! If you are expecting anything more, like a compelling and motivating narrative, memorable characters or a beautiful world design, do not waste your time with this, alternatively wait for a sale. I do not intend to sound too negative by the way. If you are a fan of Souls games, it is an enjoyable experience, especially in coop. I just don’t want the average player to be fooled by some paid of testers or overly excited You-Tubers with a huge preference for these kind of games.",Average

3512,remnant-ii,31-Jul-23,7,"Pros: - jumping adds parkour mechanics- highly improved texture and polygon quality thx to UE5- classes make the game more accessible and customizable - auto revive, melee builds, ....- they still reuse a lot of elite enemies as bosses, but at least they give them now new moves and game mechanics- very clean 3D minimap and general map- core gameplay loop is pretty addictive- a lot of well hidden secrets to find in the world- high amount of replayability- 20–30 hours of playtime on the first run- the game does not handhold you- no microtransactions- no ingame shop- no battlepass Cons: - bad netcode in coop play (desynced boss fights)- resource starvation (extremely low currency/scrap drop rate)- many pointless dead ends level design wise (procedural generation)- stuid enemy AI that does not see you even if you stand right before them, which may work in a melee based dark souls game, but does not work in a shooter.- very unevenly paced enemy density in some of the more open areas. You can walk for minutes without seeing an enemy and then suddenly 20 enemies spawn out of the ground at once.- boss design relies heavily on adds, constantly reuses elite enemies as bosses, mostly balanced around multiplayer- worst optimization ever (only runs fluid on nvidia 3000+ gpus with dlss turned on, if you want to play on high graphic settings with 1440p/4K and a high framerate ( 80-140 fps ) a 4090 gpu is mandatory  )- some animation have just way too many recovery frames ( literally all melee animations , standing up after getting knocked down takes 6 seconds, vaulting )- writing is bad (nonsensical story, annoying voice acting, pointless ESG tutorial, your own character sounds like Steve Urkel, absolutely forgettable NPCs for the most part, 2nd grade philosophical storytelling, the story in the first one was slightly better and less intrusive )- flat and static lighting- stiff facial animations and outdated looking faces- gunslinger class gated behind preorder bonus Conclusion: It is a pretty fun game overall. Quality-wise, it's roughly on the same level as the previous game.They improved in some areas (texture quality, polygon count, giving your character the ability to jump, improved 3D mini map and 3D map in the menu, more accessibility with certain classes having access to self revive and summons right from the start) but at the same time they also deteriorated in other areas  (atrocious writing, forgettable NPCs, dreadful technical performance, low enemy density in some more open areas, resource starvation, gunslinger class locked behind preorder bonus, 50 $ price point for an AA game) Overall Rating: 7.8 I would give the first game ""Remnant: From the Ashes"" a Rating of 8.2",Average

3520,remnant-ii,30-Jul-23,5,"Please let us NOT normalize mediocrity,just because everyone else is making terrible games...Comparing it to the previous iteration, From The Ashes, there's a lot similar - characters, zones, even some dialogue and story. Even some of the puzzles are almost identical.What's new is the slower grind, outrageous bugs and glitches, and worse performance.Leaving a relic menu can lock character inputs, performance issues can cause input lag resulting in double inputs or no input. Dodge rolling this time around is not as precise as other similar games and levels often are unforgiving (death ledges and narrow hallways). Scaling this time around makes most, but not all weapons feel like you're never getting any more powerful. For example, my starting rifle killed first zone normal enemies with two body crits, and at +7, the mobs still remained two body crits kills.The story is nothing noteworthy. As this is a spoiler-free review, you be the judge. All in all- the game is a decent co-op experience, but slightly more boring as a solo experience. The move for diverse classes and multiple archetypes is a highlight. If you missed the last game you have more of the same in this version.",Average

When I buy such GPU - I expect high refresh rate gaming 140fps+ in 4K, not just barely hitting 60fps in 1440p and while ofc DLSS helps - as I said this is no more than excuse from lazy devs who didn't bother to optimize jack **** The real problem is - no everyone is running RTX 4090 like I do, so what about those people? Screw them devs? Or they should run 1080p with DLSS in performance (540p internal rendering)???

It’s astounding to think that if I were to create a list of my favorite soulslikes, my favorite looter shooters, and my favorite procedurally generated games, Remnant 2 would appear on all of those lists. This is a triumphant sequel that doesn’t just reimagine the soulslike genre as a co-op looter-shooter, but absolutely nails that concept in nearly every way – including many that the original did not. With completely engrossing combat, challenging and memorable boss fights, ultra-dense buildcrafting options, incredibly cool procedurally generated levels, and a clever multiversal concept that allows for a ton of different adventures in one package, it’s very likely going to become one of my most-played games this year.

3533,remnant-ii,28-Jul-23,9,"Absolutely loving this game so far, coming from someone who is generally very disappointed with most popular releases. Was just trying to fill time before bg3 or exilecon , but to my surprise this turned out to be my favorite game of the year so far, maybe even including last year as a second place after Elden Ring. The highlight for me has been the extremely fun, engaging and unique bossfights, theyre thouroughly well-designed and more mechanically interesting than any I have seen in any shooter, even the side-dungeon bosses. The gameplay is refined and fun, there is satisfying character progression and loot, very interesting puzzles and secret hunting. Also, I was pleasantly surprised by the range of interesting builds you can make with skills, rings etc. it seems as if other reviewers are review-boming and has not actually played the game, since they heard that the developers reduiced the trait cap from a bloated number in the first game, and assumed this meant less room for buildmaking. Althought I did not play the first game, I would argue the opposite, as it forces you to decide on a gimmick or a few, rather than just speccing into everything without any regard to what you choose. Theres also the multiclassing, and selection of skills within the classes, which by itself would usually be considered by most as more than enough for a coop shooter of this type. The game is also very innovative in how it randomizes the entire campaign, incentivizing me to play both on my own and with my friends,without fully commiting to either, and not having to do almost any duplicate content. Performance drops after extended play like others have mentioned, but for me having to restart every now and then is not a big deal, as I get at least a couple hours with 100+ fps.",Positive

3542,remnant-ii,27-Jul-23,10,"This game is the definition of fun due to its unique procedurally generated levels, enemy combinations and tons of secret hunting which secures itself fresh each time you are going after something in the game. Dual archetype combinations of more than 11 archetypes( currently known ) alone result in 55 different playstyles, not including the limited set of trait points so that you can't max it out and you have to swap them according to your playstyle, tons of rings, amulets, weapons, weapon mods and mutators on top of them. Story consists of scattered randomly generated storylines that serve the larger focused storyline and giving you bits and pieces about the world by putting you in the place of a character, while explaining it through different npcs and visual story telling. The combat in this game is fluent and brutal, it's a combined dance of mechanics at play coming together and boosting the fun by a huge margin. There are many melee and long ranged weapons that you can find in the game and upgrade. You really feel like your character is getting advanced as you keep playing it. This is such a great feeling and it nails this formula by borrowing it from its grand ancestor Dark Souls. I especially liked what they did with the melee system now and I can play a dedicated melee build to wreck my opponents. This game is 100% doable solo if you want to keep your pace to yourself. The game has a lot to offer and it's an upgrade to the Remnant : From the Ashes. There's a high number of build variety resulting in many different playstyles. Puzzles are eye opening and require you to think deeply. The game gives you all the necessary tools to overcome its meaty challenges. If you are looking for a game that is a challenging rpg, souls-like and a shooter that combines together the greatness of several genres into one hella meaty game that you'll not even notice hours going by while playing it solo or coop, then this game is definitely worth a check. You may have performance issues based on your system and your video card's upscaling technology. I personally had no issues and no bugs except for one when I had lost internet connection and the game locked me in the connecting menu when I tried to connect back again manually.

3553,like-a-dragon-ishin!,9-Mar-23,9,"Another fantastic game in the Like a Dragon series. Like a Dragon: Ishin! has been quite a surprise because, a priori, looking at the setting, it looked like a completely different mood compared to other games from RGG Studio, in this series but, right at the start of the game, we can already see that this will, in fact, be a great game within this franchise. I’ll start talking about PC performance, on my Ryzen 5 3600 and RTX 3060 Ti system, this game performs amazingly, it’s pretty easy to run it way above 60 FPS at 1620p DLDSR downsampling (from 1080p native, my main resolution), Max Settings, and no need to use Upscaling at all.I choose 1620p DLDSR over 4K DSR because I find it looks better in this game, but 4K is also doable at 60 FPS, might need some Upscaling though (in which case I suggest XeSS over FSR 2.1, the former looks a bit cleaner overall, particularly at Ultra-Quality, but both can experience some temporal shimmering artifacts though, be aware, minor ones…but they exist). In the PC port we can find the expected settings from previous RGG games, so it’s all in there, including an FOV setting and pretty Customizable Controls. With the 1.03 Update, the game is free from any Shader Compilation Stutters, it runs pretty smoothly now, except very small hiccups right when a loading screen happens, nothing major there. When it comes to Characters, this half remaster, half remake of Ishin brings back some good old favorites from previous games in the series, which is really nice to see because I really like their actors’ performances, both here and in those other games, of course. The Soundtrack is the usual high quality from RGG games, with some character specific tracks from previous games coming back but with new arrangements fitting the era this game takes place in, a nice touch indeed. Gameplay wise, I mostly found the combat to be pretty decent, this is after all a PS3 game with some improvements and the combat feels it’s from that era, but it’s not too bad once you get used to it, definitely it’s not the worst in the series.I played on Hard Difficulty and the game felt relatively balanced, except in a couple encounters here and there.The more skill points we get, the better the combat becomes, that’s for sure, and that’s a good thing. Again, not the best in the series, but I enjoyed it for what it is. Speaking of balancing, I found the Crafting system to be the weakest link here in this game, it’s nice that we have it, but it creates an unnecessary grind, if we want to level up the Blacksmith to a decent level to take advantage of discounts, or to unlock all the crafting variants.Surely, it’s meant to be combined with the rest of the “Another Life” activities such as Farming, but it’s a grind, nonetheless, and some people may not like that.Optional, for sure, because you don’t really need to craft anything in order to complete the game, you still get decent weapon drops and other items when defeating some bosses, but if you want more cool items and such…yeah, you either use certain money making exploits, or grind. All in all, I’ve enjoyed this game quite a lot, the story is pretty moving, with many epic moments and boss fights, it’s full of characters with so much charisma and the ones that got changed, from the OG release, to this remaster/remake, fit in so well in the story, because their actors are top tier. After playing this game I am now more eager to know about the next game in the series, Like a dragon: Gaiden, and of course looking forward to the day where Like a Dragon 8 arrives, likely next year.",Positive

Characters are fascinating and well constructed with their own stories and personalities. The landscapes and graphic aspect are marvelous, I loved taking photographs of everything I see, even things that are just pretty and not a story's game related prop. The journal customization is very appreciable, I loved spending time put photographs by colorimetry, record songs I liked to hear, add texts and stickers that made a whole identity.

The combat is entirely based on you, the player knowing how to effectively stop your opponents from attacking you, whilst breaking their defenses and exploiting weaknesses, not all characters start off good and require significant monetary investment before they become good,  not to mention failure to prepare for boss fights, not having the perfect team to counter bosses makes for a very frustrating time, prepare to be annoyed at cheap mechanics and overpowered enemies. The gatcha system naturally with promises of better characters etc etc - absolutely no balance to the game here, as I mentioned everything is so specifically overtuned and frustrating that no skill is involved here unlike Genshin where you could actually use skill to beat bosses and encounters, this is entirely on-rails, linear as heck spreadsheet battles with the player always at the disadvantage,  great game if you're willing to shell out a few thousand dollars every few months - its the miHoYo way after all, distract your players with waifu's and husbando's so the feckless masses will throw away their life savings to show off to their friends, and cosplay their favorite characters at cons - make no mistake, this is not a good game.",Negative

3585,honkai-star-rail,7-Jun-23,7,"Yet another gacha game enters the mobile game scene, and it is from a familiar company, Just with a different name. HoYoverse, earned their renown with their massive success title, Genshin Impact, is looking to expand the business still with their next game. As their new title suggests, this game is aiming to start a genuine universe of their own. It is true that Honkai: Star Rail hands us the same poison all the other mobile games nowadays do.Pulling a character is their major content, and there is no such thing as ""full game."" It is definitely not complete on release, and it'll go on and on, as long as it can reach your wallet. The game is only about a month old, and yet the content will dry out quick if you really go at it. But there is also a good news. coming from a major company with quite a few successes under their belt, the game offers a delightful presentation. The visuals are pretty enough to let you get attatched to the character without much reason, and the sounds have weight to appreciate. Story itself is more or less redundant. It won't leave any impression on you, and it being added with a time gap doesn't help either. Interesting things about this title is that they don't really urge you to spend money on it, which is rather refreshing, coming from a big name like HoYoverse. There are lots of decent characters within reach, and there is virtually no content that makes you wrestle with the others. No ranking system, no guild stuff, nothing. If that is your thing, this game will be very blend. Gameplay is standard business. You go through story stuff, along with the side quests, and you farm everyday for 10 minutes and try to find anything to keep yourself entertaining until the next update comes through. Like most of mobile games played on PC, this will probably be your side flavor, rather than a full-screen business. It won't take a long time to get used to the PC controls, and I think the best part of all this is that your phone having a much needed time off it needs. Just like any other gacha game, you won't miss out anything if you look past this one. But if you had to choose your poison, this game could be up there on my recommendation list.",Average

But it has been made for mobiles, and feels weird on PC. The game takes 2 weeks to finish the main story and all side quests. I feel sorry for whales who already spent $500. Still it takes months of grinding, I am not sure how that can work. The game is just plain linear, one long corridor. Dialogs cannot be skipped. Good luck surviving the boredom of the first two hours. Characters, scenery, pretty much everything looks grey and blue. It is quite depressive, and no near the beauty of Genshin. Combats are auto-play, meaning the game has an integrated bot feature. You click and forget, and come few minutes later on the fight is over. A game that you don't play, definitely for mobile and not PC. The game is Pay2Win, period. Paid Event banner characters are crushing any others. You can already feel the game won’t be enjoyable as a free player, all the good characters will be behind a steep paywall. The question I asked myself is: “is it worth investing in a game you are going to play 2 week every patch?” Unless you are a collector or a whale, and you feel rich by collecting 5 stars characters, it is a hard pass on HSR. As a 2nd opinion, I suggest you watch TenTen videos on Youtube. I’ll be trying out Blue Protocol, Wuthering Waves, and Diablo 4.",Negative

As with most other mihoyo games, there's:- incredible world building- great story- amazing character design and general aesthetics- great music- incredible polish- one of the largest player bases of any game ever even though it just launchedAs for the things mihoyo has improved on:- no paimon- MC has actual personality - character interactions feel natural- jokes are actually funny and don't reference memes that were popular during development and are now outdated- some of the best writing I've seen overall (writing is generally very good in mihoyo game but this took it to the next level)- very F2P, they found a good balance between being challenging and fun but still not being too easy if you're F2P, unlike GenshinAs for the things that continue to be a main criticism:- ""energy""-type ressource that refills with time and locks you out of upgrading characters- Gacha aspect, although better than with predecessors, the best characters are still only unlockable through luck or money- Everything's overpriced if you want to spend money (100$+ for a 5star character) Although the main criticisms persist, they've been improved greatly to a point where I'd argue that Star rail is generally more F2P friendly than the majority of free games out there. You can get hundreds of hours of enjoyment out of it without spending a dollar. If you want to buy something, there's still the relatively cheap option of buying a ""pass"" for 6 bucks that gives you about 50$ worth of premium currency over the course of a month. The game itself is actually so well-made and fun that I'll probably spend a thousand hours or more. One of the best games I've played recently for sure and, with hundreds of hours in mihoyo games already, I've come to genuinely enjoy mechanics like the Gacha, even as a F2P player. I feel like people often forget that you can get dopamine hits from Gacha without spending money. If you're F2P and you play daily from the beginning you'll be able to get most if not all characters you want eventually. In conclusion, this is the best mihoyo game yet. It's free and it's not that big, and even without spending a penny you can enjoy a great story, great characters, great writing, great mechanics and a beautiful aesthetic. While mihoyo still uses predatory methods to get you to pay, I believe as long as you think of yourself as someone that can withstand such things you won't have any problems. If you're a gambling addict, I'd be careful.  Other than that there's not a single reason to not try it out.",Positive

Also, the story and characters are prime, and very clean I greatly look forward to seeing what they add next. And of course, this gets many negative reviews because people just hate on gotcha all the time. Also the people's super low attention spans. Hate turn-based nowadays and don't understand it. I mean come on at least hate on it for valid reasons lol, this game is quality and a lot of people are just babies when it comes to some stuff. Anyway, great game!

Give me a polished game like this each and every time, with an excellent, old-style turn-based combat system, nice writing and lots of interesting sub-systems, instead of the terrible, recent PC ports from the so-called ""AAA studios"". Great job by Mihoyo, this game is truly entertaining",Positive
3605,honkai-star-rail,4-May-23,3,"I actually love the combat system. I know a lot of people hate it, but I think there’s a lot of strategy in the team building. This is pretty much the only reason why I’m still playing, but I’m very much on the fence if I should continue. Now for what I hate (in my own opinion)… First, this game is hellish when it comes to progressing through anything, especially the main story. There’s only 120 trailblazer energy which refills extremely slowly. Items and other progression materials are insanely difficult to get because of this. Sometimes I wonder if it’s worth spending weeks just to progress the smallest amounts for a somewhat bland story. Second, the side quests are the worst thing to get through. It is literally teleport/walk from point a to point b repeated 7-8 times. But what else are you gonna do to get trailblazer experience? By the way, fighting enemies doesn’t give you trailblazer experience and barely gives your characters any level up experience. Pretty much the only way to gain trailblazer experience to get on with the main story is to do these terribly boring side quests or wait for the extremely slow recharge of the 120 trailblazer energy. Third, this game IS a gacha game. You can indeed get through with just free to play units. There are a few units that are insanely more powerful than the rest though. Also, using the free to play units can get bland and if you want to try new characters, they are stuck behind a paywall. And it’s a pretty expensive paywall. (In conclusion, this game feels like a worse Pokémon game. Imagine playing Pokémon but only able to encounter 5 Pokémon per day. Good luck ever leveling up and progressing through the story. Also, you’re given 6 Pokemon to start out with instead of 1, and they don’t suck but aren’t particularly great. If you want more Pokémon, you have to pay $10 for each pokeball, so it better be worth it if you decide to spend. As you continue playing through the game, which mainly consists of you logging in just to defeat the 5 daily Pokémon for experience, you wonder how long it will take to complete the game and if it’s even worth the time leveling your team which you don’t feel too attached to because they’re the boring default Pokémon.)",Negative

The gameplay wise is just not fit to the series, It also take the breaking glass effect from DMC5 which is even worse. For a few minutes of gameplay, it's sort of fun, but for a few hours later, the gameplay is even more boring than Genshin by keep us collecting things and watch character skill animations, just like we're actually playing on a PowerPoint. I have nothing against turn-based, but It not what make Honkai series fun, remember GGZ? It was a good experience for a mobile game those days, and HI3rd also did the same thing. Now?

3609,honkai-star-rail,2-May-23,9,"После Геншина я ожидал чего-то ужасного, скучного геймплейно и инфантильного сюжетно. Я ошибался. Сюжет: Квесты и основной сюжет стали гораздо приземленней. История как правило связная, целостная и логичная в отличии от той же инфантильной воды которую вы могли видеть в геншине. Персонажи более живые и мотивированны на совершаемые действия (кроме пожалуй одного). В целом отметил бы много неплохого драматизма, сделанного лучше чем ""Щеночек умер, плачь если любишь щеночков"". Визуал: Как всегда на высоте, даже лучше чем в прошлых играх. Если вы конечно не плюетесь от этих китайских мультиков. Геймплей: Боевка интересна сама по себе но при этом, кроме пары ньюансов, проста для понимания. Имеется автобой что экономит море вашего времени.Контент ""Виртуальной вселенной"" особенно хорош, местные пути (специализации roguelike бафов) позволяют настраивать прохождение под вашу группу.

Локации стали закрытыми что дополнительно упрощает эксплоринг. Глобально игра приятно выделилась на фоне душного и нелепого геншина, да и многих других гача-игр. Надеюсь что она не будет сильно сбавлять темп, а работу нормального сценариста в очередной раз не отнимет горилла-фанфикофаг пишущая сюжеты в духе ""Мы доброе добро против злого зла, которое раньше было... добрым добром... но...

However, it's still a game whose sole source of revenue is gambling which automatically means they definitely don't make their billions of dollars without some predatory business models. Even looking beyond their gambling downsides, the game is just plain mediocre. It genuinely just feels like someone made a live-service Star Ocean game. If you've ever played Star Ocean: The Last Hope then you're going to get lots of feelings of deja vu.",Average
3613,honkai-star-rail,30-Apr-23,10,"The game is amazing. The story has a nice progression, and the characters are well-developed. When it comes to combat, miHoYo has managed to make the turns more dynamic through the use of ultimate skills, which can be employed at any time. The characters also appear to have a balanced power level. However, not being able to skip certain combat animations can be a little annoying. The scenarios are considerably linear, but on the other hand, they are packed with easter eggs and dialogues with NPCs, which makes exploration a highly enjoyable experience. As for the gacha system, it is acceptable, considering that the game is free-to-play and primarily focuses on the story in a PvE setting. With a bit of luck and dedication, it is possible to obtain 5-star characters even without spending money. When it comes to animations and design, one word sums it up: breathtaking.",Positive

3618,honkai-star-rail,29-Apr-23,9,"This game caused me a great storm of emotions. Before the release I had only played Genshin and knew almost nothing about this game, except that the battles there are turn-based, so I started playing without understanding what's what, but after a couple of hours I got involved pretty quickly.The game has no open world, which is neither good nor bad. It's just a fact. The game is corridor-based, but the locations are made very nicely. Overall, this game is more about tactics and story and not about exploring the world. It's just such a genre. The plot is simple, but the interaction of characters and the player with the world are written here brilliantly. Very often caught myself laughing my heart out, which I don't often get in games. The characters themselves here looks interesting and prescribed the same. Different characters, looks have a positive impact on the immersion. The music here is nice, on different locations it is different and well conveys the mood. Some of the tracks I would add to my library. Battles here are turn-based, which allows you to play tactically. The animations in combat are top notch, particularly the superpowers. There's auto-boys, but you don't want to use it in quests at all. It is ideal for farming resources, which reduces the routine to a minimum. On the technical side, everything is great here, too. The game looks great and on my RX570 the game runs perfectly at 60 fps. There is gamepad support, but it has some small problems here, I think the patches will fix it. In general, the game I am very pleased. Yes, this gacha, but if you have control over your greed, it is not a problem at all.",Positive

3621,honkai-star-rail,28-Apr-23,4,"- Story is good at first space station part but many part don’t explain anything and confusing. The story after the space station are decent or even worst. Sometime story transition to next cutscene don’t make any sense feels like they cut out something or rushes skip when talking half way. Also after space station you will start to feel most of the talking have no voice now, and you start to get a lot of text reading with boring stuffs and random baby level of puzzle stuff to do. - Story voice line some parts have low volume and some part have loud volume, it seems they were recorded in different studio or places. It is annoying but more annoying part was mouse arrow keep teleport and blocking the center view of cutscene! - Main female character is voice by Yui Ishikawa Japanese voice actor that cast Mikasa/2B, but entire story she never opened her mouth to speak but using telepathy and stare at people by text all the time. The only time when she thinking in her own head, then you can hear her voice or in battle. - Stamina...it uses same stamina system in genshin where stamina is extreme low and extreme slow to recover, it takes 18 hours to recover! - The main story progress will become harder when you not able to grind for exp book to lv your characters when run out of stamina trailblazer power/resins very early progression. Later you will struggle even more because you don’t have good characters, because free characters will start to struggle with story battles and boss fights. Then main story also require your trailblazer level at certain level to unlock it, they lock you from progressing for few days, unless you willing pay real money to recover the stupid stamina trailblazer power/resin to grind for trailblazer exp. - You CANNOT skip story! Just like genshin lmao - A turn base game without option to skip animation! Yes, you CANNOT skip animation as well! You can x2 speed up but some animation was so goddam long even in x2 speed up jesus... - The gacha rate is same as genshin, extreme terrible lowest rate compare to all other gacha games out there. It was written as 1.6% chance of getting a 5* but so far looking at global players draw rate, it is around 1-1.1% chance only. - Daily quest, you only get 1 daily quest per day. But you also have daily training which comes with mostly easy task and you get 60 gem for complete all of them. You might also get some gems from beating boss or rare monsters, but still unsure is it one time thing or daily. - Simulated Universe is a weekly reward thing where you do not need all the strongest team or stamina and you can get all weekly rewards by just grind the easiest level over and over, the points increase until reach the cap of weekly. - Forgotten hall is the genshin abyss the most p2w end game content and most hated by f2p players. - Yes it also have battle pass, as always like genshin, it is the most worst battle pass out of all the games out there. I rather sub final fantasy 14 for 1-3 month to access everything without have to do any chores than this trash battle pass rewards. - Mutiplayer? NOPE! It doesn't have it, it is SINGLE PLAYER only! but you can add friends and use their chosen character for very few limited fight, you CANNOT use friend character in any of the main story content to help you cheese through at all! - Graphics. They are amazing good obviously and photo mode is the most painful thing in the world...camera movement and angles are all extreme restricted even not in photo mode! - Exploration. It is not open world, it is very small hub level area. Exploration is great at first as always but I think most of you who play any action games or genshin knew, you never explore again after you seen it. - Game stability, like genshin, they share the same bug that can sometime crashes or turn black screen and froze your pc if you playing it while having any web browser open. I'm on high end pc just so you know. Conclusion, I don’t see any worth of investing into this SINGLE PLAYER turn base game compare to other Japanese turn base gacha game where you have option to get strong by leeching in anyone raid and get material or weapon drops to get strong as f2p than honkai only option is pay gacha and stamina to get strong like genshin. Also in Japanese game you can even play 24/7 without running out of stamina so much better than honkai/genshin stupid long arse 18 hours for trailblazer power/resin to recover!!!!!",Negative
3622,honkai-star-rail,28-Apr-23,3,"Honkai Star Rail is a turn based RPG with a similar setting to the Star Ocean series. Where this game really falls apart is the storytelling. First off, it uses the overused and bad writing trope of having an amesiac protagonist. Even worse, one of the main characters that joins your party is also an amnesiac because the writers couldn't find a good way to tell a story without shoehorned amnesia. The worst part of the storytelling is simply the game throws a bunch of terminology and then they don't explain any of it. The whole point of having an amesiac character is so that other characters can explain the world to them but that doesn't happen in this game. For instance, what is a Doomsday Beast? What is an Emanator? Who are the Anti-Matter Legion? Who is this Stephen that Herta speaks up? What is a Stellaron? Why are Aeons showing up in a simulated universe? Basically, the game throws out all these terms and characters and doesn't explain them at all which makes the world building quite awful. Later on in the game, you get access to a Database which explains some of this but even that is awful story telling: the story should be told through dialogue and cutscenes, not through some optional encyclopedia. The turn based combat and graphics of the game are quite stylish. There are some quality of life features missing. For instance, every character has an out of combat technique that they can use but the overworld UI does not tell you what each character's technique does. Either you have to memorize them all or go into the menu to look it up every time. Combat is relatively straightforward with every character having 3 moves and 1 or 2 passive abilities: a basic attack, a skill attack, and an ultimate which can be used any time you want. The goal is to target enemy weaknesses to delay enemy turns and deal extra damage. Here, the quality of life is really nice because you get to see all weaknesses displayed in and out of battle. This is one of those games where there's just so many different types of crafting materials and currency that it's hard to keep track of it all. It'd be much better if it were much more streamlined. There's a way to have crafting/buying systems without having hundreds of different types of materials /currencies on day 1. Overall, you should avoid this game if you're looking for a good story and good character development. But if you're looking for a straightforward, turn based game, this might be the game for you.",Negative
3623,honkai-star-rail,28-Apr-23,9,"From the moment I heard that this was a turn-based RPG, I had high expectations, and I'm happy to say that it delivered. Despite my reservations about Genshin and Honkai Impact, Hoyoverse has truly outdone themselves with this game. It's a polished experience, and contrary to what you might expect, it's not as pay-to-win as you'd think. The writing is exceptional, allowing you to not only witness but also feel the characters' development. Each character has unique personality traits that you'll grow to love as you journey through the game. The conclusion of the story is masterfully crafted, reminiscent of the epic boss fights in FFXIV. The combination of the music, cutscenes, and dialogue left me in awe. If you're a fan of previous Hoyoverse games, you'll undoubtedly enjoy this one. Even if you're not, I highly recommend giving it a try. It's truly a masterpiece. While the game deserves high praise, I won't give it a perfect score due to a few areas that could use improvement. For instance, the main character's voice acting is inconsistent, with dialogue sometimes lacking a voiceover, which feels unfinished. Additionally, certain characters don't move their mouths when speaking, leading to a weird and inconsistent visual experience. The game's multiplayer features are also limited, with only a friend system available at the time of this review. It would be great to have more cooperative gameplay options, as currently, you can only use a friend's character for daily content, without them actively participating alongside you. Despite these shortcomings, I've been thoroughly enjoying the game since its release. There's always room for improvement, but overall, it's a fantastic experience. Well done, Hoyo!",Positive

The story is humble and the world is more static; there are a few missions here and there, and most of the challenge lies within the fishing mechanics and the stylized aesthetic. Doesn't try to do too much, and they play towards their strengths. Cruising the seas, exploring the world, discovering new types of fish, new zones, upgrading the boat and talking to the few locals are pretty much all you can do; but the setting, music, themes and gameplay loops are extremely addictive.

There is a lot here- story, approachable/simple mini games that don't get stale, an encyclopedia to fill out, and decent sized map with lots of hidden goodies. Yes, it could be a little tightened up- the research/economy could be a bit more balanced after mid game (I maxed out and felt a bit too strong too early in my opinion) and the use of the pontoon boat rather than having separate towns/cities at each point of interest on the map (budget/time constraints?).

3647,dredge,14-Apr-23,8,"Dredge is a new fishing adventure RPG from Team 17 digital and Black Salt Games. The game pits you as the new fisherman in a mysterious network of interconnected islands. You must pay off your debt for the boat they supplied you with by fishing, fetching, connecting, and supplying for the various inhabitants of these dangerous islands. Dredge has an intriguing beginning, you crash landed in the area and have ruined your ship. The mayor of the town 'generously' lends you a vessel so that you can replace the previous fisherman, whose disappearance is never fully explained, of the area. Repaying your debt is done by fishing up different species and selling them for cash (a certain % of the sales goes towards your debt) and also by performing various tasks around the islands for special items or parts to upgrade your boats fishing rod capacity, lights, cargo, etc. The fishing mechanics are very simple and there is thankfully ways to speed up the process through upgrades.    The storing of fish/items and the equipment of new gear for your ship is handled in a resident evil style grid style. Fish and items can be flipped and rotated to conserve more space The boat you are given is very small and slow. Initial upgrades must be made before you can even reach the beyond the first few islands. This is due to the fact that traversal during night is dangerous and many times can result in the destruction of you and your ship. Massive sharks, krakens, and even ghosts lurk in the shadows at night, also the fog that rolls in makes it near impossible to see further than a few feet which causes impacts with rocks and islands you can't see coming. This leads to the game having a very simple, short, and addictive gameplay loop since a typical outing only takes a minute or so until nighttime and the fog roll in. You cast out in the morning, collect fish, materials, quest items, and retun by nightfall to sell/store your catches for the day. Fishing is supplemented by the addition of crab boxes and trawling nets which fish for your while you away, even catching some fish that are uncatchable anyways. The upgrade system flows nicely into the different versions of water you are able to fish from the far off and more dangerous areas. Initially you can only fish in waters that are shallow or coastal but eventually you get to fish the real big fish in the abyssal or volcanic sections. The game really does open up in a beautiful way once you are able to get some new engines installed and the haste action. Flying across the seas with the engine roaring is a fun time throughout the game. Controlling the actual ship out in the waters is frustrating at times, it does not turn as well as you would like, leading to many bumps and crashes that will need to be repaired. Individual components on the ship can even be disabled by these crashes, the worst is when the engines get damaged and your pace slows to a crawl. Also, directions for the pursuits (quests) can sometimes be unclear on exactly how to proceed, luckily the few main quests mark red X's on the map that show where to go. There are many fishing fetch quests for more rarer sea life but they are not tracked adequately in the menus, some of them are even shape based which is unfortunate cause you can only see the shapes at the drop off point they are needed, so you have to sail back and forth if you think you have the right fish which can be frustrating. The game is fairly brisk and the ending credits roll rather unexpectedly, only minutes after the game warns you there's no turning back and this is the last mission. I am not going to say that the ending was the most satisfying or engaging culmination I've ever seen but the game as a whole worked well. Played exclusively on steam deck with no issues.",Positive

The panic system for instance looks cool but is often quite redundant, as the game finds few opportunities to actually force you to sail in the dark (e.g. some fish require night catching, but can be caught from 6pm, meaning your job can be done quickly and early before panic becomes a big issue), so most of the game can be waited out for daylight. The actual horror aspects I also found to be pretty poorly utilized too, with each isle having its big evil fish to deal with, yet they all end up just feeling annoying rather than scary. Also once late game comes around, you realize that fishing takes a backseat in favor of some pretty boring puzzle mechanics that result in the game losing its engine, ending in a bit of a sputter.",Average
3652,dredge,4-Apr-23,9,"If you like fishing mini-games akin to ones like fishing in Stardew Valley, you will love this game. Very stylized, great music, calming gameplay. Definitely nothing watching you beneath the waves. Just a normal fishing game.",Positive
3653,dredge,3-Apr-23,0,"When I saw the gameplay of the demo I thought it was just another garbage. However, I wanted to give it a try, hoping I was wrong.But no, unfortunately, I wasn't. It is a delivery boy simulator. ""Hey, dude, bring me this, bring me that, do this, do that"", without any real interest in seeing what happens when you complete the task and, in some cases, the game tells you: ""the person leaves without giving you anything in change"" WTF? I mean, you've done a job, for nothing, because it's not even entertaining. It is that you have to fish and dredge and, although the name implies it, it shouldn't mean you have to spend 99.99% of the game fishing and dredging, but yes, yes it is. Fish and dredge, fish and dredge, for all eternity. Because the crappy boat you have is improved with things that are quite expensive and what you fish and dredge is not worth a damn. It is barely enough to repair the damage, some of which is caused by the slightest touch against a rock.And the story? Better to watch both endings on youtube, save your money and use it on something much better than this overhyped piece of trash.",Negative

3676,planet-of-lana,28-May-23,9,"A beatuiful, almost wordlessly told story about loss, new friendship, mystery with a gorgeous art style and a coherent orchestral score to condense into a perfect 3h playable puzzle adventure. Recently the entries into the ""indie"" scene in adventures and story-driven games were a dime a dozen - but a rare gem like this comes around once in a while to satiate your adventure appetite. The game leaves you with the protagonist (Lana) on who's planet you'll be the witness of a very mysterious alien attack, for lack of a better word, of mechanical beings preying on your fellow village friends and family - after a harrowing loss of a loved one and a chaotic escape to follow the same fate, you end up stranded, alone in a magically beautiful hand-drawn world. There, you seek to find your lost brother and quickly make a new friend in the form of ""Mui"" - who seems to be a world-dwelling species much like a cat - after rescuing Mui from a hairy situation with the new overlords of your world, you quickly become interdependent friends - and friends help each other, as we all know... so Mui becomes an integral - and mysterious - part of your journey and search for your lost brother, by adding capabilites to reach tight spaces or out-of-reach things at first and, no spoilers, adding somewhat more mysterious skills to help you out in this strange world. Since we are talking about a ""physics type"" puzzle game, expect a lot of pulling, pushing of stuff to get to places - and later on you'll even learn a nifty new skill that helps you to intervene with the machine intelligence seemingly seeking to enslave your planet. Traversal of the character is flawless, the controls are fluid and our little friend Mui is not only cute, but has in itself some pretty fluid controls which you need to master, either by letting him stay in place, quietly, or reach for switches just at the right time. The progression and difficulty curve is just in the right amount of upwards slope so you can learn the ropes before they ask you to climb it and swing. Due to the foreign language, the few spoken words, the game intentionally makes you fill in the dialog and you get the gist of it quickly - less words leave you to drawl at the beautiful landscapes the creators hand-drew and the beautifully fitting orchestrated soundtrack. The journey overall takes you about 3 hours tops and the only side quest item would be to find hidden ""shrines"" - that if you do tell you in a mysterious way what your invaders might be or where they come from. Planet of Lana is one of those rare gems that will resonate with you after you finish them. The game and its story are beautifully made and leave you with this satisfying feeling after watching the end credits.",Positive

I'm not a fan of cats in the first place due to violent allergic reactions so an option to replace the cat by a dog would have been nice for accessibility reasons (even a warning would have been nice!)  I've also seen some people complain that you can't rebind the controls but I think it creates a shared experience that's central to the themes of Planet of Lana (with all gamers experiencing the game with the same controls), although I have to point out that the ""pro-environment"" themes border on propaganda considering how thoroughly debunked ""climate change"" is at this point.

Sure there is things that I expect to be there, like customisable controls, but I've heard it's on the way. After all, this it the devs first game, so I'll give e them some time to fix bugs and missing features. I could definitely recommend this game for new players in the genre, and for people who like a good experience.

Had a few minor bugs but nothing game-breaking.",Positive
3701,coffee-talk-episode-2-hibiscus-&-butterfly,14-Dec-20,7,"I enjoyed the game, but it's not at all what was advertised. We were told it was going to be a deep RPG with immersion as good as RDR2, well that obviously didn't happen. It's buggy and glitchy, yes, and it doesn't run well for most people unless you have a NASA computer, but those things can be fixed and actually don't factor into my review of the game in the slightest. My biggest issue with the game is that it's entirely superficial, the world is big and looks beautiful but where are the things to do besides shooting people? I was expecting mini games, something like Gwent, or brain dances, hell, Wakako has a pachinko parlor, why can't we use it? Cutting hair, getting piercings, tattoos? None of it. Then there is the AI, and I can't believe a game released in 2020 with an AI system like this. The police outright spawn behind you, there is no chase system, no wanted system, no corrupt rich and powerful to send the police as their own personal hitmen, all things that were promised. Run away from the police after gaining a star? It's like they've never seen you before. But if you stand too close to them? They shoot you. There really isn't much things to do except things involving combat, and while combat is fun, it's not really all that fun to do it over and over again. I wanted to enjoy the city, not just the combat. Hacking is okay, but a little boring. Same with stealth. Personal story also has very little impact on the game, I remember they were planning to add in a whole ""traumatic life experiences"", ""childhood hero"" etc, but all of that got scrapped. It makes your beginning of nomad, corpo or street kid feel hollow except for the occasional dialogue option that honestly doesn't change much. And what was with the montage at the beginning? Why couldn't we experience those times with Jackie? Would've made him and events of the story surrounding him much more compelling since, ya know, we'd actually have time to get to know him. You could've showed us, not told us. Something I can say about the game though is that the characters are very well written. Honestly it's the cast that really drive this game, their growth and depth are really well done and CDPR did a great job of making me hate, then love, then love-hate, then love again a certain character. But I'm a little pissed extra special attention was given to Judy and Panam, while Kerry and River took the backseat by being entirely easy to miss by being tied to side quests, unlike our ladies. Give a little love to our homies, CDPR. Which also brings me to the point of why the heck did they censor all the dongs in the game? It was there in the tech demo. Full frontal nudity is okay for women, but not for men? Give me a break, this is a bleak as heck world, a scrapper wouldn't have the courtesy to leave a man's underwear on if they only viewed them as meat and valuable tech. I also want to bring up the endings, I won't spoil anything but I can say I don't particularly like any of them, and again, they favor the girl romances in certain endings. I really, really hate open ended endings that tease things ""oo, maybe a dlc? maybe not? maybe a 2nd title?"". It's lazy, annoying, and doesn't really give me a sense of closure. And anyone saying ""happy endings, in a cyberpunk setting?"" yes, happy endings. Things that reward the player. I'm sick of games lately adding numerous endings but they're all just different variations of bad ends. It ruins the journey in my opinion.",Average

Many complain about the poor optimization, but personally, with my [GTX1080 / Intel E5-1680 (4.4ghz OC) / 32GB DDR4] setup, I managed to play at a stable 60fps by lowering the graphics settings to minimum and making some tweaks with Nvidia software.

3715,wo-long-fallen-dynasty,25-Apr-23,8,"Souls açlığıma bir süre iyi gelecek oyun oldu. Sekiro gibi parry'ye dayalı olsa da mekanikler onun kadar keskin olmadığı, oyun da onun kadar zor değil. Ama yeterince tatmin ediyor. Souls oyunlarına getirdiği bazı yenilikler var. Bunlardan ilki, genele bir level'ınız bulunduğu gibi, bir de her bölüme geçtiğinizde sıfırlanan bir moral seviyeniz var. Bu moral seviyesi düşman öldürdükçe artıyor ancak siz ölünce de düşüyor. Düştüğü minimum sayıyı artırmak için haritadaki bayrakları bulmanız gerekiyor. Bu bayrakların bir kısmı bonfire işlevi de görüyor. Bir bölümdeki moraliniz en fazla 25 olurken, bulduğunuz bayraklarla düşme seviyesini 20'ye kadar çıkarabiliyorsunuz. Bence her yeri keşfi teşvik eden güzel bir yenilik olmuş. Oyunda ruh seviyeniz var. Bu ruh, özel yetenekleriniz, büyüleriniz ve parry'leriniz ile artıyor. Stamina gibi ama biraz farklı. Mana ile birleşmiş gibi. Bu bar tamamen dolunca karakteriniz bir süre hareketsiz kalıyor ve saldırılara açık hale geliyor. Düşmanınıza hasar vererek, saldırılarını geri püskürterek siz de onun barını doldurup savunmasız hale getirebilir ve öldürücü vuruşu yapabilirsiniz. Boss savaşlarında çok işe yarıyor. Direkt tek atmıyor ama epey can götürüyor. Oyunda büyüler var ama bana çok işlevsel gelmedi. Birçoğu gereksiz. Benim en çok kullandıklarım silahınıza elektrik veren büyü ile hasar verdikçe canınızı artıran büyü. Özellikle ikincisi sayesinde büyücü olan ve yanına 20 tane kendisinden spawn'layan boss'u geçtim. Oyun ortalarına kadar çok ilgi çekici gitse de özellikle son çeyreğinde hafif sıkıyor. Bunun en önemli nedeni artık hiç yeni düşman tipi gelmemesi ve çevrenin çok tekrar etmesi. Hep aynı düşmanları, benzer yerlerde öldürmek sıkıyor. Ancak boss'lar için aynısını söyleyemem. Birbirlerinden çok farklı boss çeşitleri var. Çoğu da gayet tatmin edici. İki boss'la kapıştığımız ve birinin diğerini silah olarak kullandığı savaş epey farklıydı mesela. Ama boss savaşları genel olarak kolaydı, bazısını tekte geçtim. 1-2 tanesinde bir saat uğraştım. İlk defa bir souls oyununda kargı benzeri bir silah kullandım. Oldukça da keyif aldım. Yapımcı Nioh'taki loot ameleliğini aynen devam ettirmiş. Hatta bir kaç yerde envanterim doldu. Bir de onları satmakla uğraştım. Bölüm tasarımları bence gayet iyi. Küçük haritalar, keşfedilebilir yerler var. Elbette From Software oyunları kadar iyi dizayn edilmiş değiller ama dümdüz koridorda da gitmiyorsun sonuçta. İnsanı yormayan, keşfi teşvik eden ve bunu ödüllendiren bir dizayn benimsemişler. Nereye gideceğim demiyorsunuz. İyi bir denge tutturmuşlar. Hikaye gereği yanınızda 1-2 npc sizinle beraber savaşıyor. Düşmanın ilgisini çekmek dışında bir işe yaradıkları söylenemez. Neticede 26 saat oynadığım, son çeyreği hariç gayet keyif aldığım, düşman çeşitliliği yetersiz olduğu için başyapıt olma fırsatını kaçırmış bir oyun olmuş.",Positive
3716,wo-long-fallen-dynasty,22-Apr-23,5,"The gameplay was enjoyable at first, but later on I started to get bored and after 25 hours, I think I will delete the game. The fighting dynamic based on evasion starts to get really boring after a while. In boss battles, you have to memorize their big moves and take away more health by parrying, other than that, when you hit, it takes very little health. This is not a very good combat design. Like I said, it sounds fun at first, but then it loses it. The storytelling is also classic Koei Tecmo style and mediocre. Performance problems in the PC port are also an issue that should be criticized.

3717,wo-long-fallen-dynasty,19-Apr-23,5,"Like other games from this developer like Nioh I enjoyed playing, but there are 2 main problems with this game. The first problem is the design of the levels and jumps. The design is horrible, enemies standing in the worst possible places, weird turns and turns. The places where you have to jump are also poorly done and the jumping in this game is done disgustingly. The second problem is the bosses. The first half of the bosses are elementary bosses that are passing with 1 try, the other is unbeatable monsters that can not be passed, and for the 50 attempts only if you do not clean the entire location, which will give you small advantage over the enemy in the form of higher levels. Bugs were not noticed, it was interesting to play, and investigate the location, too. The plot and characters are interesting only if you are very much interested in the Chinese style, although it is made by the Japanese. Basically if you love the souls like genre then you can pass, if not I would rather play Sekiro with which a lot has been taken for this game.",Average

3722,wo-long-fallen-dynasty,31-Mar-23,3,"character limit is too short. full review on steam. Wo Long is a bad game; made by amateurs using the skin of previously good games related to it, to disguise it's significant shortcomings. I've 100%'d it and beyond and played 175 hours. I have everything, I've done everything. I've experimented extensively with everything. Every spell and skill, all weapons and armors and bonuses, in every mode. I'm the only one I know of who has no-hit the bosses on NG+ legit no cheese and have the final title that comes with that accomplishment. I probably played the game much more than the devs have. This game is a lesson in paying attention to the credits to discover who was working on the game and who was not. Since it was made by Team Ninja with significant visual Nioh influence, I figured it would be good. I was significantly disappointed. It seems most of the Nioh team did not work on this game. This feels like the C or D team made Wo Long. This is the director's first title and it massively shows. I feel lied to and taken advantage of. This game is a hollow shell of a real game. It is without substance. The core components are there but this feels like a rushed demo than a real game. Perhaps this was a tech demo game in the same vein as Chaos Legion was for Devil May Cry on the PS2. But they did release an actual demo and that is to be commended as demos are a lost action in the games' industry and so incredibly important. I'm very appreciative to the company for that integrity move. But I digress, Wo Long is a watered down, aka ""streamlined"", action game in the vein of Nioh/Ninja Gaiden/Sekiro/and maybe a little Metal Gear Rising Revengeance set in the Three Kingdoms period of ancient China. However, the characters and events are there in name only. They are tangential, cursory, barely recognizable and hardly significant. It's a poor excuse of a backdrop to rehash the template of Nioh. Amrita is now Elixir, the MacGuffin of this nonsense. Kelly is now Yu Ji and the protagonist is chasing him for what was stolen just like William did. There are one or two good twists I'll give them that, but one important character relationship is a near direct copy of Otakamaru and Suzuka from Nioh 2. Yuan Shao honestly complains about bonds and laments the power of friendship. It's enough to make you puke with how trite and stupid it is. If a computer AI spat out this ""story"", I would not be surprised at all. Nothing has any impact despite the attempts to. The last stage is a revisit to the first stage, but the character you are supposed to have a bond with only appeared in those two stages and the game acts like it's an epic encounter. No, because obviously we spent zero time with the character we were supposed to care about. It has all the trappings of emotional build up and investment (the music, the stage revisit after time passed, the atmosphere) but falls embarrassingly flat and for obvious reasons that I can't believe they actually tried to pass off. Again, if a computer was programmed to spit this out, I would not be surprised. Beep Boop. Input emotion here. Are you invested? I'm playing the music! Remember this!? Please clap. Hell, they even did something like this in Nioh 2 and it was fairly decent, so AGAIN, with so much taken from Nioh, how did they mess up so bad? It's a stolen template without any soul. The English voices are terrible but since characters talk while fighting, I kept it in English so I could hear them because gameplay is too intense to read text while in combat, which is always a dumb thing to do in any game. I'm engaged with the combat, why are you having characters talk in the very instance I physically can't pay attention to it. However, the Chinese and Japanese voices seem fine. The non-player character designs are not good. Unlike Nioh, it was not gratifying to see famous figures from this legendary setting. Almost no one stood out and I was not excited to see them. This is a great shame because one of the best things about Nioh which took place in Sengoku Japan was wondering whom would surprise you around the corner. And then actually having cool encounters! It was exciting and satisfying. Not so here. Even the music is rather bad. Maybe one or two good tracks in the game and I think one or two were taken from Nioh. But the main problem is how much is reused. Too many main levels reuse the same track (snow level and rainy level for example). It makes the game feel cheap and shallow. But I will say the game looks good. The effects look good, the sounds are good (when they aren't glitchy -- I had dialogue vanish from a cutscene, return for the next, and vanish again for the following one, except for the nameless grunt soldiers for some inexplicable reason) but it's all in service of bland level design. The game gives you distant vistas in some levels and they look like they are from the PS2 or 3 era. The levels are so boring and uncreative. And t",Negative
3723,wo-long-fallen-dynasty,29-Mar-23,4,"I don't know why this team always like to copy other generas back in 2012 they were coping Monster Hunter games since they were popular and I have there game on my PSVita it called Toukiden. Now there trying hard to be like Dark Souls or Sekiro. Thank God I tried this on Game Pass and deleted after the first Boss. The only difference is that you have a blind co op guy with you but his AI is so bad to kill these bosses while the Bosses only Agro on you. I hate that every time you check point the enemies respawn like in Bloodborne so I gave up on this game it's very hard and the bigger enemies are not fair. Once you died you loose your ""Souls"" and you get your revenge back when they respawn so it's a copy cat of Dark Souls so I'm not into it with Ninja Gaiden controls which feels smoother but it isn't better.",Negative

Nioh was already confusing but with a bit of research you could get a grip on it. This is just insane. Allies becoming enemies in 1 mission. Next mission they are back to being allies. Crazy mcguffins left and right and so on.The game is fairly challenging but not as hard as the souls games and way wayyyy easier than sekiro. The rpg elements are satisfying and the forgiving crafting and respec system lets you change builds on a whim.",Positive
3726,wo-long-fallen-dynasty,24-Mar-23,9,"As for me game feels like interesting collaboration between Nioh and Sekiro. By Nioh part i mean loot system kinda similar to ARPG like POE Diablo and etc. where you can get several similar base item with different substats spells and so on. By Seciro part i mean a stamina system and parry based battle system. So as for me this cocktail of both game work really good (i'm surprised that alot of people think opposite).I read a lot of negative reviews and i have one question did you even read what this game say to you? but probably at first few hour i also doesn't read and tried just to rush and panic roll the first boss but that doesn't work. And that the main reason why first boss so hard for most people i think devs maked it so hard (in case if player dont wanna parry his attack) to make player understand timing of attack, teach player how to parry, and understand main philosophy of the gameI say it this way because if you embrace it and start playing with the parry mechanic (I think it's only needed for a few bosses, to be honest), the game seems a lot easier than Elden Ring or the Souls games. But lets talk about other aspects of the game it has good sound and graphical parts - it looks and sound kinda pretty in chinese art style. Another aspect that cath me fo several hour is blacksmithing you can reforge your weapons increase it stats change substats and eveen transfer look of the other weapons to your favourite one. Plot is also kinda ok (cuz i don't got it XD) some thing about friendship power that can beat even world evil. As a conclusion it's great game for someone who enjoyed souls like games / nioh and ARPGs. Just try that game (if you didn't) and if you beat first boss you probably complete all game without any difficulty.",Positive

Had to awkwardly switch back and forth between my xbox and PC for bosses to play, as my VP9 codec wasn't working and it would softlock whenever a video cutscene tried to play. This, combined with me needing to fully update my windows 10, on top of generally a bit poor performance optimisation, stopped this from being a strong 9 for me. The story isn't anything ground breaking, but the gameplay is a fantastic blend of Dark Souls, Sekiro, and Nioh. Unfortunately it only rarely treads into the Sekiro territory during the Lu Bu boss fight, and in the final fight. I think if it had stuck more to that premise, and kept a more consistent difficulty curve, it could have been something truly memorable. That said I still think this is a very good game, and would gladly recommend it to anyone who enjoys skillful action games, and/or the Three Kingdoms setting.",Positive

3730,wo-long-fallen-dynasty,18-Mar-23,3,"Incredibly poor game design.  The entire game is gatekept by a single, reflex related ability - deflect.  If you cannot get the deflect down you can not progress out of the tutorial.  If it was just defeating a single phase boss, fine.  But to have two phases that rely on reflexes ONLY is a really, really poor game design choice.  The only reason why it is not receiving a 1 from me is that it was made available on Game Pass so at least all I was out was time and space on my SSD. I was able to get to the second phase multiple times but the pace of the deflects changes drastically.  Also the deflect window is inconsistent and the hit boxes for the first boss are obscene, making any dodging impossible.  The same is true of the second phase.  If it were a single phase I could understand it.  I think I will stick to From Soft games.  At least there I can find multiple ways to progress.",Negative

If you want a challenge and are good the system punish you with making the game easier, if you are bad at the game it punish you by making it harder. This system also undermines the system for leveling.The different areas in which missions take place are for the most part ok, some are bad, some are good, and one is so bad it makes me wonder why the devs hate the playerbase.Things like the magic and martial arts makes me think that this was either not tested enough or that the devs ignored any and all negative feedback, the cost and risk vs the reward when using them is simply not balanced. Still, when the game works as intended the combat is very entertaining.If not for the performance issues this would have been a 7 or even 8, but when a game does not work it is a 0.Team Ninja, fix your game.",Negative

Surprisingly there's even a not bad story and a bunch of very nice and magical CGI. Nice and atmospheric music.There are problems with jumping difficulty that spoils the impression that the final bosses do not represent any difficulty, and on what would be a ""Aoye"" can spend a dozen tries.It's nice that in additional missions there are not only pieces of past locations with mobs, but also the bosses.The downsides are there, but overall I liked the game and it was a pretty interesting adventure that ignited my interest in reading the past works of ""Team Ninja"", namely ""Nioh 1"" and ""Nioh 2"", which was a big mistake because I haven't seen anything worse than these games.""Team Ninja took 5 steps forward with ""Wo Long"" compared to the ""Nioh"" series.",Average

The cutscenes can't be skipped, and after 20 mins of gameplay, the saves are nowhere to be found.

When I bought the game it said I would have access to all episodes. It did not say anywhere that I would have access to all episodes as they are released over the next three months. This was misleading on the developers end. If they only had one episode ready for release they should have had an option to buy that episode. Instead the charged $44.99 and said you would be getting Episodes 1 -5 plus bonus episode. No where, anywhere, did it say episodes 2-5 plus the bonus episode would be released sometime in the future. I should not have to research a game in advance to make sure what they are offering me is in deed what I will be getting.

I have always been a huge fan of The Telltale Games, it has become very obvious to me that the spark that gave life to the older games of Telltale is no more. It's very clear to me that the newer developers cared more about how the game looked then they did about creating an environment with both a compelling story as well as characters that you naturally gravitated towards. These characters are so forgettable... Dull, that's the only word I can think of when I think about these characters in the story,  The protagonist has this very strange monotone voice that gives you meaningless narration throughout your gameplay, and her colleagues that around her do not provide any sense of camaraderie,  or any sense of belonging with the very minimal dialog options you have to interact with them. I really hate to compare the new developers with the old, but I will never forget that first episode I played as Lee in The Walking Dead series when I ran into Clementine. Their interaction was so believable and genuine. It glued me in the moment I played it for the first time. Something is missing, I don't feel a connection between the characters and the protagonist. I don't think these developers realize that the thing that drew us in so closely with the older games was literally the story itself,  and how the characters interacted with each other. I am honestly kind of sad that this is all they have to bring to the table. A little bit of profanity doesn't bother me when I'm trying to indulge in a story, but it needs to fit with the circumstance.

3799,the-expanse-a-telltale-series,29-Jul-23,6,"TL;DR: is it good? I’d say yes – but it depends if you like the series and want the backstory. If you expect “grandeur” action gameplay, this is going to disappoint you. It’s also too short by far - EP 1 takes about 1-2 hrs max. Mind you: We’ve only seen EP 1 so far - It might get much better during EP 2-5 and Bonus Ep in Deluxe Edition. Long:Get this if you enjoyed Camina Drummer's Belter drawl and see where her fierceness comes from. You'll get a kick out of this telltale games ... Expanse of the Expanse's storyline (yes, I am proud of myself). If you are expecting a good old time ""Walking Dead telltale"", sadly it's not there and maybe never will since you know... they went bankrupt and just got ""revived"" by selling their tech. This new showing of grandeur past is initially gorgeous, with its 4K graphics shine on the next gen consoles and PC, the sound design is minimalist, which is apt for a “Sci-Fi” genre game – since no one can hear your Dolby Surround in Space. Music has been licensed from the series and the Acting is quite decent – if maybe a bit generic by some of the voices, but that is well based on the script and material of the Series as well as this storyline. It was on and off also in the “old” games mostly, if we’re being honest. And while we’re being honest, let’s talk about the actual gameplay: Since the revival would give the new telltale the true chance of redoing some of the core systems and improve on some QoL changes, sadly, in this regard they failed. The new game does work exactly in the same way as the old ones – if a bit flashier in execution - they still have the same “Quick Time” aka “press a button or fail” events – which to be fair now you can extend the time to “infinite” taking the pressure off a lot. The new studio has tried to mimic what made telltale games so good in the first place, namely the very narrative-driven, dramatic ""choices"" - which in the end, sadly, never made that much of a difference to tell you the truth. But they were excuted in a grand way that gave you satisfaction and a hell of a good story most of the time. Does ""The Expanse"" do the same? I think you can see the first inning of what could potentially be a very cool, albeit very short story in the ""Expanse"" universe just before the Amazon Series storyline picks up in full force. You'll follow the life of Carmina Drummer, a hard-ass ""Belter"" who's been around the deck as they say - and who is a member of the so-called ""OPA"" - something that gets hinted on bascially immediately - which basically is a terrorist faction within that Sci-Fi Universe that made it a point of hating ""Earthers"". The rest of the game”play” consists of a Space Walking/flying simulator with banter in-between the main characters, of course the usual twists and betrayals plus the “choice” making which consists of the occasional banter in-between characters with good to OK acting by the cast – Carmina Drummer stands out, as well as the Captain and the Ship’s Medic, the two goofy sidekick “Belters” are just like in the series – hard-ass but not smart-ass loose gun types, a job well done in scripting and acting. All of these characters have their “motivations”, although you’ll only know if you pick your choices and see the usual “XYZ will remember that” when speaking to them or interacting with things happening as they unfold, taking some tough choices along the way. Whatever it means when you see “they’ll remember that” stays shrouded in mystery as per the telltale formula. To be very honest, I actually think most of these have, if at all, only minor implications outside of a few changed voice lines likely. And that is the core of the main flaw, one the new telltale kept from the “old telltale”: what these games are usually good at is giving you the momentary illusion of making a huge choice – but when you dare to replay to see the “other side” of that outcome, it usually disappoints by showing you it’s ending (almost) the same way, no matter what. You might kill off one of the others, but guess what, it barely mattered outside of a few standout changes in TwD series games. I’m not spoiling anything here, but be prepared that choices seem “bigger than they are”, just like in your rear view mirror. Since the story has just started it's unsure if her OPA past is coming to hunt her, but it certainly looks like exactly that is going to happen in the 5 Episodes and the Bonus Episode for you Deluxe Edition buyers. I went Deluxe, because I could not stop myself wondering if telltale legacy can be revived and I’ll stand by to make my final calling after all Episodes are out sometime in September likely – they are saying a new Ep every two weeks – which would probably be the most dramatic change from the “old telltale” which had issues releasing Episodes in a timely manner. Which is what ultimately killed them.",Average

I want to say that this game is many times worse compared to the first part. I don't understand why the writers made Degan Gera and Rayvis the main villains, they are the most boring and not charismatic characters. It was not interesting to follow their story. I'd rather see a Sith villain, or Inquisitors, someone connected to the dark side of the force. And it would be better to reveal the life of the galaxy during the reign of the empire. I also expected that we would see Saw Gerrera again, but this unfortunately did not happen. Liked that they improved the combat system, added a lot of finishing animations, but dudes why there is so much parkour in the game, I don’t understand.

Since it couldn't be refunded after playing for 2 hours 45 minutes, I missed my refunding window. It was some shady tactics that the first two hours of the game seemed to be the only optimized part that didn't have any critical issues. So, couldn't refund it, only option was to finish the game or admit I'd just thrown 90€ to the bin. The rest of the game became a slog of avoiding bugs, ignoring screen tearing and fps drops, taking off my headphones whenever the audio glitched on cutscenes. Fights were tricky with fps drops and resolution dipping to 480p. Sceneries were cool - the few seconds they lasted until textures disappeared - if they loaded in the first place. The first impression ruined the rest of the game for me totally. I hear the PC-version is nowadays mostly fixed, but I have no interest in ever going back to this game. I've seen the story, experienced the fights, so why would I? It was a horrible slog to get through in all its unfinished glory, and all the more frustrating because it would've and should've been a good experience, if only they'd bothered to release an actually working product. I feel scammed. This game soured me for any future sequels or DLC's. And I'll not be giving EA or Respawn Entertainment more money until user reviews are out and mostly positive on their upcoming releases. So, trying to be as objective as I possibly can, I'll give this experience a 4/10.Not a shovelware like Gollum, but still not a very good value for its high price.",Negative

3810,star-wars-jedi-survivor,22-Jul-23,8,"All in all this game improves almost everything that the first game had. This game has a better story, better combat (mostly), better music and etc. But the issues it has is what makes it slightly worse than the first one instead of being way better. First of all, the stances. one handed is not really useful, crossguard is way too weak to be that slow, the pistol stance is not really as good as it's supposed to be and that is mainly down to the ammo being limited instead of a cooldown. I mainly only used dual wield and dual blade in some rare occasions. The skill tree was a little underwhelming if I am being honest, too many situation based skills instead of overall good skills. The open world approach was a good idea but not well executed since the maps were huge but not filled with much, yes there were a lot of side objectives to do and make the game feel fresh but the rewards were not worth the trouble at all. This also made the game feel less fun in general and why it is ultimately worse than the first one (by a small margin). This game has such a better story, improved gameplay, slightly better antagonists and much much better customization. Yet none of it matter when it falls short on the key aspects, let us take the boss fights for example, I beat the game on the hardest difficulty and instead of bosses being challenging, they were just spam attacking and that's all that made them ""hard"", you just needed to do the same attacks for 6 minutes to beat them and it became so annoying and boring. In the first game bosses were challenging and fun to beat. Performance wise as of writing this review, the game ran very smoothly on a mid end pc. I have a few more small annoyances to mention but I think my point has been maid. Great game but forgot what made the first game so good and fun to play, this game just ended up slightly soulless and only fun to star wars fans.",Positive

3850,star-wars-jedi-survivor,21-May-23,6,"Good game, but it shouldn’t have released in this state. I normally dedicate a good portion of my reviews to PC performance and for Jedi Survivor here I cannot ignore the poor state the PC version still is.The game launched with very poor CPU and GPU utilization issues, which after thee patches after release, five in total counting the ones implemented right before launch, has improved a bit, but not enough to call it a smooth experience, at all. You see, the planet of Koboh is the main area in this game, we spend 80% of the time here and always end up coming back here, also at various times in the day and, particularly when its night time, Koboh exhibits pretty poor CPU performance and very unstable frame times.This is even without Ray Tracing, but enabling it makes things even worse, as expected, sin Ray Tracing has that extra load on the CPU side of things too. On my R5 3600 and RTX 3060 Ti, I’ve played Open World games such as both Spider-Man games with great performance, even at 1620p DLDSR, but Jedi Survivor here can’t even do stable 50 FPS at 1080p, running around the Harvest Ridge riverbanks in the central hub area of Koboh where the Pyloon’s Saloon is.This is even with RT OFF, and increasing resolutions doesn’t really do much to improve the poor CPU performance in this game: the code has serious bottlenecks and I have seen the numerous reports, with frame data analysis, from users with much more powerful rigs than mine, also showing how unstable the frametimes can be. Brute Forcing through a bad PC port of a game can only help until a certain point, the game is still under performing for a lot of people no matter how much hardware you throw at it, compared to similar or even bigger current generation games. I take my time to test every update that releases, and while I have seen CPU improvements being implemented, which have improved Ray Tracing performance by 20-30%, the starting point for that uplift was so abysmally low that not even a 30% increase feels decent, also because the frame times are still very bad, reaching the 100 ms area quite often. So, the game still needs more patches, as of May 21st of 2023, and I have just completed the main story, so let’s talk about that a bit now. If you liked Jedi Fallen Order, this game is a must to play, even if you choose to wait for more patches, the Gameplay is fun, the Exploration is a lot better than the previous game, more stuff to discover, cool secrets and encounters, it’s all in here. Music is pretty decent, with some really epic tracks for some of the most exciting moments but also many of the more dramatic ones. This is truly a game crafted by Respawn for sure, something you may forget while playing until to reach a certain set piece at the end of one of the planets and you instantly go “yeah, this is 100% Respawn, no doubt”, and it feels awesome. Characters are very detailed, graphically, and well animated, and when it comes to their writing, I like most of the main cast stories and how they develop. Level Design is superb, some of the vistas in Koboh are spectacular, everything is seamless when going from one place to another, so good job there Respawn.The game looks excellent when RT is used, and a bit weak on the Lighting side if RT is OFF, which is a shame but nothing major. Asset, Geometry and Material quality is great, it looks like a Current Gen game for sure. That said, I have some issues with how they wrote most of the villains and antagonists, I’m not getting into spoilers, but I feel that for the second game in this series, they should have taken a few extra risks, particularly what can be considered the “main villain” through the first two thirds of the game…felt quite hollow in the end to me, how their fate came to be, among other issues. That alone would make be just score this game at like 8.5 or 9 over 10, it’s not terrible that some characters are poorly written, overall the rest are quite amazing, but I cannot ignore the current state of this game on PC, and I’m aware it also has severe issues on consoles, which in the end all come from the same core issues, like having crashes on PC when RT is enabled in one of the planets, I’ve seen consoles also crashing, and so on. Unfortunately this means I have to score this game at a 6/10, until they vastly improve its code. Yes, to me performance is worth a whole 3 points at least, it is crucial, I’m not asking for the impossible either: plenty of good PC ports out there, including some from very modern and demanding games. I hope this is not the end of this IP, and they do more with it in the future, I support Respawn in their decisions and I like this franchise a lot, but they need to fix this game’s performance.",Average

Exploration, puzzle-solving, combat; and customization are the strong points of this game and are all excellent. The game is absolutely huge and there is tons of things to do and places to explore, even after finishing the end of the main story. Story itself was a mixed bag for me. There were certain moments that I really liked such as Cal and Merrin, Cere vs. Vader, and the final showdown on Tanalorr. However the High Republic B-plot was extremely lackluster, not adding much to the story of the game with Dagan Gera and that other Jedi being extremely forgettable characters. Technical department is where things are not so great. While certain parts of the map looked visually amazing (even on a PC with 8 GB ram), there were other parts of the map and (especially the Mantis and Pyloon's saloon) where the texture quality was extremely low or non-existent completely pulling me out of the immersion. This game could have definitely had more time to bake in the oven and it's really frustrating an expensive $70 game had such poor technical issues.",Average

3866,star-wars-jedi-survivor,14-May-23,0,"At time of writing, this game has been out for roughly 16 days, has received at least 4 major patches, of which one was over 120 GB meaning that it was a major overhaul for the entire game, and the company, EA, has blamed users for not being able to run their game. This implies that the game was released prior to it's completion and that it is actually a beta release, despite the clear lack of labelling to identify it as a beta or work-in-progress build. After a handful of dedicated users who are also programmers took a look in the game's code, they found that there is an excessive amount of repetitive and superfluous code that could easily be removed with no effect on the final product. Some of these programming gamers have even claimed to have removed up to 50 GB of extraneous data and code from the game and have the game work better than it is for a large portion of players around the globe. It would also appear that the newer or higher end your computer is, meaning if your PC has specs meeting or surpassing EA's recommended specs (check their or steam's website for more exact details), the less likely you are to be able to open or run the game in the first place. Which has, understandably, upset a large number of individuals across the world. Of note, this 155 GB (See recommended SSD space on the EA website) product was released as though a full game. The standard edition is for sale, both physically and digitally, for $70 USD, with an optional $20 USD ""deluxe"" edition that adds 6 cosmetic items, roughly $3.34 USD each. Beyond that, an internet connection is mandatory for this single player only game, likely because of EA's data collection and for the purposes of providing these mandatory updates to actually allow the game to run in the first place. But this mandatory online requirement means that should EA's servers ever shut down, which to this reviewer seems ever more likely with each major ""release"" of theirs, everyone will lose access to the game permanently, as there is currently no known method for game preservation for online only games. So to sum, this game was released as though a complete game while operating and acting as though a beta or work-in-progress build, it is online only despite being single player only which causes many issues, is among the largest games file-size wise on the entire market at time of this writing yet if these programming gamers are correct then roughly 1/3 of the game's size is completely unnecessary and can be removed or cleaned up to actually enhance the gaming's functionality and experience, and throughout the world this game seems to be unusable or unplayable for roughly 40% of users (Going off the Steam Reviews system for that data). Now while I wish I could review the actual content within the game, this reviewer sadly cannot as their copy of the game is unusable despite owning a high-end PC that surpasses the recommended requirements to run this game.",Negative

So, you can’t get bored because if you bored, you can change your stance and continue your game with a new combat style. Also, storytelling is better than fallen Order.

I love fighting, even though perfect parries and evading got harder than the last time. I remember playing Grandmaster difficulty in previous Jedi installment and Jedi knight in this one and it feels harder to do defensive moves. It has so much more content and way to get extra force/healt/skills and usually you enjoy addressing the challenges related to it. There's one nice open world that you keep exploring. Some challenges for skill points are extremely difficult and you should prepare few hours to finish them and potentially some backup controllers in case you break some ;) Bosses are reasonably doable, not really frustrating if you come prepared. The only real problems I had were with one particular lizard like creature, and some Jedi bosses at the end. I didn't have problems with gameplay, although the game could look a bit better. I had to scale to high level of detail and turn off raytracing with GTX3060 and 32gb ram, 13th generation of Intel processor. It wasn't running that smooth if not done. There are lot of bounties and collectibles. Customization was very nice and I enjoyed it. Generally I would say this game was better than the last one.

Some cannot play the game. Steam refusing refunds. All scummy so I have to knock some points off. BUT if you are able to play the game it is worthwhile, and this is coming from someone who doesn't complete games. This game is NOT buggy in the way like The Last of Us (I gave that game a 0). But the bigger question, is it worth 70? NO. However I must commend the care, attention, and otherwise thought put into the game's story and setting. Definitely one of the better games in recent release once the performance issues are fixed. Some will be put off by the traversal.

The new quality of life improvements help elevate the gameplay over Fallen Order. That, however, is where the positives end. The story starts off strong but then the game tries to tie the story to too many Disney properties (Rogue One, High Republic, Obi Wan etc...) that it never fully leans into leans into anything fully and you end up with one dimensional villains. By the end the story falls flat and into a tone deaf finale. Now, I started off with very few issues on PC with slow downs to 10fps only on the galactic map and intro, but after the May 1st patch the town on the second planet is in the 30s, and any interior location with npcs to interact with never rises above 40fps. Yet when I am out in the wild I get a good 60-90 fps even fighting enemies. I have had two CTDs both in meditation chambers meaning I had to start the puzzles all over. Dynamic cloth like capes and sashes will go crazy and I have encountered sound issues and artifacting in certain points though they do not always occur. Wait to see if EA continues to patch or resolve the issues before buying. To those that give the game a glowing score because they assume the game will be fixed, just remember EA and Bioware walked away from Mass Effect Andromeda before fixing all the bugs.

3929,star-wars-jedi-survivor,2-May-23,1,"It is a disappointing game! Following the CD Project Red Legacy: release an unfinished game as long as it makes money. It’s the worst game, performance wise, after Cyberpunk.It had everything to be a good game, but it wasn’t. PC with 3090 or PS5, doesn’t matter, performance is still garbage. Even downgrading graphics or disabling RTX on PC or with Performance mode on PS5… almost unplayable at times.  Performance mode is a problem altogether. Doesn’t give you an acceptable performance and makes the game so… sooo ugly. But you don’t have a choice either play at 30 fps at performance mode or 10 fps with fidelity mode.If you thought they make a bigger, better game, its not the case. They didn’t make it bigger, or not in a manner that counts. Maybe it’s part of the lore, but Cal is still the weakest jedi ever. Skill tree is kinda big, but you don’t need it. Doesn’t make you stronger because almost every low opponent can resist everything you throw at them. You only need and will be effective using parry and attack. Stances were a good idea to fight smart, but it doesn’t work either. You can’t equip then on the fly like Ghost of Tsushima. Some stances are too slow, that the simplest attack, makes you take a hit because every opponent has really fast attacks. Low enemies were actually harder and took longer to kill than bosses. The story is very predictable. The “open world” aspects its very affected by the performance…. Why would you want to explore this stuttering, low fps, blurred world?! Why bother earning exp to spend in the skill tree if it you only use parry and the force doesn’t work on 80% of the enemies?!If you like Star Wars or maybe liked the first game and will buy the game no matter what, buy it but wait a couple of months. If you play it now it will not meet your expectations.",Negative
3930,star-wars-jedi-survivor,2-May-23,2,"I never review games, I particularly don't go out of my way to do so but felt that morally if I could prevent EA from pulling one over on at least one person I had done my good dead for the day.First of all I have played 9 hours of the game I have adequate hardware to run this particular game with an i7 9700k, RTX 3070Ti, 64 GB ram, and am running this on an SSD. However the game runs awfully. Though it appears to jab with the insulting ""optimising for best gameplay experiance"" whenever launched. I also take the so call ""appology"" as a further jab from the developers as ever backhanded blaming the consumer for a poor product performance not the work that went into it. If my specs meet the recommended I expect it to perform as suggested.The game takes an almost obscene 129GB of storage space for a single player experience. This issue I feel was made worse by my purchase being activated on the ""EA"" launcher the now rebranded origin which had a poor reputation at best. I can only imagine this was made necessary as origin was always viewed by those around me as the poor man's steam. A pale imitation of it which a more suspicious person than I may note the lack of a review function within to be somewhat a smart ploy on EA's behalf to avoid criticism impacting on sales. Further to these issues with EA's launcher which took an outrageous 4 hours to download a 3.3GB patch today and apply it with the launcher seemingly verifying the contents of the game to do so which I note steam manages to avoid doing. When launching this afternoon I note the icon absent for my desktop with the launcher now again ""repairing"" the game taking a further few hours to do so before it can be launched. The PC was off so I don't quite know how that issue has arrisen.The actual game. What can be said. Its Jedi fallen order but a bit more of it. It looks nice but that appears to be the majority of it. Until the last patch it would not run in excess of  60 frames with constant memory leaks causing near 70c temps on a CPU. It's hard to keep up with button prompts with frame stuttering that has no place in a ""AAA""  experience albeit the i7 I possess is not an exact equivalent of the i5 recommended it is close enough and monitoring CPU usage during gameplay it does not bottleneck here. Sadly although I enjoyed the first game this feels like there has been little expansion. The combat consists of small bands of enemy's smattering around the land from wierd creatures made up for the experience that feel out of place somewhat in star wars. This is broken up by significant portions of platforming and puzzles which I must be honest is at this point getting dull. I don't get the Vader or Luke hallway scenes just a few enemy's that should not challenge a jedi or prove more than a slight inconvenience. The inclusion of at least one none Jedi/Sith lightsaber wielding enemy is strange at best. I am supposed to be advancing as a character. Some faceless goon with a lightsaber should not prove more of a challenge than an inquisitor let alone simple fodder why they were a mini boss I will never understand.Your force powers appear weaker, given the time between games and the apparent character growth your connection to the force should have been stronger between games or at least better practiced which feels off woth you relearning abilities you had unlocked in the last game. The 5 stances braged about are a joke with only 2 available to be equipped at any one time there is no reason they could not all be available on a scroll  or selection wheel or such. It's good enough for GTA V miriade of weapons it's good enough here. In stead I have stances I will never use like crossgaudr which is slow and lacks long termblocking or blaster which replaces special swings for fireing the offhand blaster when the dualended stance or double saber combinded with single blade alone are in my opinion better. Its is galling to see the blaster on my hip knowing I'll never touch it.Finally the bugs still infesting this game are numerous. The day one cutscene debacle was perhaps the most funny with audio falling out of time which is a first for me a welcome achievement there. The menu issues with back buttons not responding locking me in menues leading to the inevitable Alt F4 restart. In summary I'd like to recommend I really would but.- It is at this point an unfinished PC mess. Appearign to have more in common with a rushed PC port of a console game.I am sick of paying to test a game for EA games for them batte front 2017, BFV, BF:2042 was the same mess- It's a jumping/ walking simulator with brief breaks for small bouts of combat at worst with a small squad sized group of enemies - Don't even think of getting this on ""EA"" launcher.- Looks nice but frame rates tank often.- I'd wait for it to be fixed and a discount a real shame again EA's shamefully boot it out and we will fix it later attitude is on full show for all.",Negative

Tried lowering the resolution to 1440p and it didn't help improving the FPS much - got closer to 48FPS, which is super odd. Also FSR settings did not make any difference. The poor FPS seems to related to the scale of the scenes and how open world is. I can only achieve 35fps at most in the open world scenes but managed to get 60+ FPS in smaller scenes. In other world - this team is very inexperienced in building Open-world games and this might the the core of the issue. In this case I'm not sure if any patch would be able to fix it. Low FPS is not even the most annoying part - the camera stuttering making this game unplayable at the time being. Every time you turn the camera more than 90 degree you'll see major stutter. Again - this is particular painful in open world scenes, you can't really do any fighting when it just constantly dips below 30fps. Don't buy it now, wait for it to be on sale and fix these issues. Another disastrous AAA game launch.",Negative

This thing CLEARLY needed more time in the oven, and it’s a shame that couldn’t be afforded the developers here.  The previous game in the series had performance issues also, but was manageable.

No. Why no? Because from 2017 to 2023 the technology difference is not something to go Aw. But a game from 1999 did not have good graphics according to today's graphics, did not have the advanced technology, and did not know about different game designs that could fit in the survival horror.So now if we don't go Aw in a game remade from 1994 to 2023. Then WTF did you remake?No game is 100% perfect. Then why would you not change anything and you call it a remake?Just because this game looks good from afar, does not mean it is good. Having the aesthetic from 1994 is one thing, but keeping everything pixelated doesn't make it a remake. Just having modern assets is not the main focus of a remake.Back then they did not have good AI. But now all we have is AI.

4084,system-shock,2-Jun-23,10,"It's by far the best way to experience a classic and understand why it's such a classic. Modern games have taught us that the developers will make sure that we do not get lost in their game and constantly present everything on a silver platter. I forgot when was the last time I felt in the game that I was not led by the hand, but really given food for thought and space for experiments. For those who are going to try this remake, I will only say one thing, give the game a chance, let it rock a little, because the first 2 hours of gameplay can be very confusing, but I would call it a period of adaptation to a non-standard gaming experience, which not every modern game can let you experience.",Positive

To introduce controls and some initial story info - it was clear Hacker was into TriOptimum for a long time and they tracked him down.- Weapons' upgrades.- Elevator music.- Some small nice old-school secrets.- Puzzles.- Difficulty.- End music from Hardware (1990) OST.- Still can beat without some weapons and upgrades. Cons.:- The atmosphere is killed. Music is changed, and audio logs are changed too. Yes, you have to be very careful even on the medium settings to beat the game. But the events on Citadel were dreadful.- Audio logs lack depth and background noises and effects. Before, you could feel it was something in there, people were fighting, trying to survive. Now, it feels like they are just in the studio.- Music is awful. Very bad work of the composer. Similar boring tracks all over. Except for the elevator theme.- Could use more scripted animations throughout the game.- SHODAN is not threatening. No depth in her character anymore (background noises, glitches, etc. - most of them are gone). This is the most significant downside of the remake. It is NOT HARD to add noises, glitches, etc. It is the job of the sound designers that they screwed up.- Bugs. ""Dancing"" corpses, some audio logs cannot be picked up. Basically, they were just lazy to add details. But they added their useless NightDive logo easter eggs, of course.",Average
4086,system-shock,1-Jun-23,10,"System Shock Remake brilliantly revives the original 1994 game developed by Looking Glass Studios. I must say, having played the original for the first time just last year, my opinion is not affected by any nostalgia. And I must say, the experience was truly incredible. It represents the immersive sim genre at its fullest potential. This game won't hold your hand; it's up to you to navigate and fight through it. It may not appeal to everyone, but giving it a try is a must, as it is a very influential game and the granddaddy of its entire genre (Thief, Deus Ex, Bioshock, Dishonored, Prey 2017…) The biggest drawback by today's standards is probably the original control scheme, which is completely gone in the Remake. The Remake stays very true to the original while adding enhancements that appeal to both longtime fans and newcomers. It's essentially the same game, playing and looking great— in general it is a great upgrade. However, my only criticism lies with the new music. While I understand that the original soundtrack may not work with the new version, it was an important part of the game's identity for me. Maybe in the future we could see some alternative music option. Overall, I am highly satisfied with what Nightdive accomplished and I can recommend the Remake.",Positive

Why is there no clue what random switches do when you press them? These things aren't ""dated"" design, they are and always have been *bad* design. The cyberspace minigame gets old really fast. I was over it the second time I had to do it. Combat feels awful, there's no feedback whenever you hit anything.

4089,system-shock,1-Jun-23,5,"The bizarre army of shills that Nightdive have built up over the literal 9-year development of this game are doing a fantastic job of rating it just above the worst-rated of the popular immersive sims (Dark Messiah, Thief 4, etc.), and indeed everything came out much better than I thought it would 5 years ago when the game was already late and going on hiatus. Unfortunately, this will not be quite enough to make the game successful. The credits list at least 50 distinct people involved in the project, and even if they were only contracted for 1/3 of the time, that's easily $6,000,000 on the payroll alone, for which they'd have to make multiple hundreds of thousands of sales on Steam to turn a profit. It seems the game is headed for the, ""kind of well-rated, but ultimately unsuccessful"" niche of the original, thanks in no small part to its dated interface, graphics, extreme development time, boring soundtrack, floaty combat, various bugs and the studio's willingness to repeatedly alienate even non-hostile subsets of its supporters. POSITIVITY TIME: The art is very cool. The pixelated textures are an affectation in my opinion, and don't come at me with ""OK zoomer"" or whatever since I played the original, DOOM, Marathon et al. multiple years before the CEO of this studio did. But, pixels notwithstanding, the art in the game is among the best fan works of System Shock I've ever seen and is more than a match for the original game. The game design is improved in several (albeit obvious) ways. This was truly the whole point of the project in the first place: to go beyond compatibility porting and move into modernizing game mechanics. Yet it still retains a surprising amount of the original game's design - more than you might expect for a relatively inaccessible game like System Shock. For this I have to praise Nightdive's grit knowing that there would probably be bellyaching about manual saves, writing down CPU room codes, time limits, etc. and including that anyway. Lastly, polish. It's not perfect, but neither was the original game in this regard. The final product, dollar-for-dollar and adjusted for age, really does feel more professional than the original. Overall, this is a SIGNIFICANTLY flawed, EXTREMELY late debut-slash-swan-song from a somewhat witless developer that was probably wise to sell out and let someone else handle their PR. There are diamonds in the rough here, but let's not kid ourselves by saying this is an 8/10 game. If it is then you may as well quit playing video games now.",Average

It's hard, always keeps you on your toes and **** slaps you every time you begin to trust it, and that's exactly how such games should feel and play. It's not a kind of a game where developers holding player's hand all the time and keep him entertained (sorry, if you want *that* kind of experience, go to call of duty). No matter how big your arsenal is or how many resources do you have, you can be beaten down to last clip and 5 hp any time. You are a lab rat in a maze that wants you dead, and all you can do is to survive, adapt and destroy it from within. Such hostile gameplay feels fresh, especially for a game that looks like AAA (ok, maybe it's rather AA,but still). On a technical level the game is still rough here and there. Sometimes it's glitching pixelated textures, sometimes AI acts dumb, but nothing gamebreaking, and lets face it, it's quite rare these days.In my opinion the game totally worth the money and time spent. Even if you aren't a big fan of the genre, give it a try anyway.

4099,system-shock,31-May-23,5,"For the most part the most significant changes done in this remake -by Nightdive studios nonetheless-, have to do with the game’s presentation, not so much with the game’s mechanics. I guess one could argue there’s some quality-of-life improvements here and there, you don’t have to battle the UI as much as you did in the original, but still, the game just has this overarching feeling of coarseness to it, where it clearly seems as if it needed a bit more polish in some pretty significant areas. Mainly the problem I had with the game was the item pickups and the lack of direction, but to be honest, it was the first issue the one that brought down my experience to a crawl, and inevitably made me quit the game altogether. This is simply a game that isn’t balanced properly, it’s all about exploration and when it works, it’s glorious, you find things naturally, and the game’s completion is rewarding; when it stops working though, it makes the game feel like a chore, and this is something that happens in later levels, that I’m not sure if people will even notice or get to them because of the level design and lack of direction that gradually manifests as you play. There’s a sense here where if the first level was created in an intuitive way, the rest of the levels feel as if they needed more polish and attention. There are times where I found myself gaining access to areas that I clearly wasn’t supposed to be in, like one where I had the key-card to get into the room, but not to open the shortcut that would eventually interconnect with the rest of the area; so, I could obtain the upgrade present at this location, but instead of continuing my path, I had to backtrack from where I came. Simply put, this was clearly an issue with the way Nightdive distributed the pathways and items required to progress, providing me with the ability to obtain the latter I required, but not the initial ones I truly needed. Eventually I was also running out of health, there were no health stations, not health pickups, nothing; eventually I did find three health pickups but each of them bugged out and prevented me from actually healing, effectively leaving me with too little health in order to progress. This was the moment where I quit. The thing about Nightdive is that they’re responsible for some incredible ports, re-releases, and remasters of past games, but it does feel as if in this case, as it was with Blade Runner, they’re just biting a bit more than they can chew. I’m kind of stunned to see this level of quality as well because deep down you can tell all the fundamentals are there, is just that -as you progress-, all the cracks in this start showing, and eventually, the game bursts.",Average

4104,the-mageseeker-a-league-of-legends-story,26-Apr-23,8,"Introduction: Being a fan of the league of legends world, this game was a breath of fresh air, but while the game in terms of Lore is excellent, in terms of gameplay is ok and lacks a bit of variety. Lore: I loved the way the game tells the story of Sylas a little better and in more detail, from the small letters and books where we read messages from the most varied types of people to the excellent characters that were brought to us throughout the game, every detail of the game helps to further enrich the universe, bringing more excitement to those who love the amazing world of Runeterra. Strengths: • Easy-to-learn gameplay • Interesting mechanics (specifically chains or shackles) • Variety of combos and powers • Characters • Better perception of the real power of the characters or Champions (something that does not exist in the MOBA League of Legends) • Boss fights are very satisfying and some even insanely good• Art • Instrumental / Soundtrack Negative points: • Not having animation cancel in combat (in a fast gameplay like this game it was a must have) • Little variety of enemies • No voice over • Some bugs • Mini quests do not have any impact on the player experience • More expensive version is not worth the purchase • It should be possible for the player to use all the powers when he feels like it Final verdict: It's a good game, I would recommend this game to fans of the genre and especially for those who like and know the world of league of legends, but on the release date the game has some flaws (bugs) and for a new player who doesn't know anything about the world I think this isn’t the best introduction since there are some parts of the story that happened before the events of this game which aren’t even mentioned. The price is ok, but for 30€ we would have asked for a slightly more polished game",Positive

But battle mage fantasy is executed very well. Story is great, it's pretty simple but it is executed perfectly. All the character are believable and the whole main character development arc as well. Pixel art is great, not so good as Blasphemous, but level design is still clean and nice, Boss fights look especially pretty. Like the fact that the game allows you to fully upgrade yourself and run a few missions with it. Want to specifically point out the J4 and Shivana boss fight, one of the best I've had in many years. ""Nocturne"" boss fight sucks tho.

The dialogues are not connected to each other. There were no bugs. There were no problems with the camera, but sometimes it flew off somewhere. Bosses are very easy, even the final boss I passed at 1 attempt. Mobs are also easy, but there are a couple of very unpleasant, especially if you know that with the maximum damage you pumped damage will only deal 15 damage, which is very small.

What was amazing was how being caught in a mission created a huge car chase that I didn't quite make it out of. I then replayed the mission and got through stealthily and things changed massively.

4115,the-king's-dilemma-chronicles,14-Dec-20,7,"I enjoyed the game, but it's not at all what was advertised. We were told it was going to be a deep RPG with immersion as good as RDR2, well that obviously didn't happen. It's buggy and glitchy, yes, and it doesn't run well for most people unless you have a NASA computer, but those things can be fixed and actually don't factor into my review of the game in the slightest. My biggest issue with the game is that it's entirely superficial, the world is big and looks beautiful but where are the things to do besides shooting people? I was expecting mini games, something like Gwent, or brain dances, hell, Wakako has a pachinko parlor, why can't we use it? Cutting hair, getting piercings, tattoos? None of it. Then there is the AI, and I can't believe a game released in 2020 with an AI system like this. The police outright spawn behind you, there is no chase system, no wanted system, no corrupt rich and powerful to send the police as their own personal hitmen, all things that were promised. Run away from the police after gaining a star? It's like they've never seen you before. But if you stand too close to them? They shoot you. There really isn't much things to do except things involving combat, and while combat is fun, it's not really all that fun to do it over and over again. I wanted to enjoy the city, not just the combat. Hacking is okay, but a little boring. Same with stealth. Personal story also has very little impact on the game, I remember they were planning to add in a whole ""traumatic life experiences"", ""childhood hero"" etc, but all of that got scrapped. It makes your beginning of nomad, corpo or street kid feel hollow except for the occasional dialogue option that honestly doesn't change much. And what was with the montage at the beginning? Why couldn't we experience those times with Jackie? Would've made him and events of the story surrounding him much more compelling since, ya know, we'd actually have time to get to know him. You could've showed us, not told us. Something I can say about the game though is that the characters are very well written. Honestly it's the cast that really drive this game, their growth and depth are really well done and CDPR did a great job of making me hate, then love, then love-hate, then love again a certain character. But I'm a little pissed extra special attention was given to Judy and Panam, while Kerry and River took the backseat by being entirely easy to miss by being tied to side quests, unlike our ladies. Give a little love to our homies, CDPR. Which also brings me to the point of why the heck did they censor all the dongs in the game? It was there in the tech demo. Full frontal nudity is okay for women, but not for men? Give me a break, this is a bleak as heck world, a scrapper wouldn't have the courtesy to leave a man's underwear on if they only viewed them as meat and valuable tech. I also want to bring up the endings, I won't spoil anything but I can say I don't particularly like any of them, and again, they favor the girl romances in certain endings. I really, really hate open ended endings that tease things ""oo, maybe a dlc? maybe not? maybe a 2nd title?"". It's lazy, annoying, and doesn't really give me a sense of closure. And anyone saying ""happy endings, in a cyberpunk setting?"" yes, happy endings. Things that reward the player. I'm sick of games lately adding numerous endings but they're all just different variations of bad ends. It ruins the journey in my opinion.",Average

4122,trepang2,23-Jul-23,4,"I wanted to give this game a high score. It's such a love letter to games like F.E.A.R. which remains a personal favorite and one of the better shooters of the 00's in one persons opinion. The combat is very visceral and punchy, it overall reminds me of if F.E.A.R. and modern Doom (for the amount of blood and gore) had a baby together. The soundtrack is also really good! However when confronted with the fact that the developers thought it was acceptable to gate weapons, attachments, and VIP targets behind a minimum difficulty, I can't do so in good faith. This is compounded by the fact that the required difficulties for at least two targets is accompanied by an actual warning stating that even the Devs have issues with it. There ARE mods that can address this issue but in all honesty, you shouldn't NEED to use mods for something like this. This goes for any game. For all their faults, FromSoft figured out that you shouldn't gate achievements behind difficult tasks pretty quickly after Knight's Honor, it's not a 1:1 comparison but it gets my point across. It's very sad that Trepang Studios didn't get the memo.",Negative
4123,trepang2,20-Jul-23,6,"Cons: * I didn't see a place to turn subtitles off, so that's a little annoying seeing that line of dialogue at the bottom whenever someone talks.* Kind of a limited story at least in terms of much detail - you're mostly learning about things via little items you pick up during missions as you read them - e-mails, etc.* There are sections of the game with monsters / mutants and I didn't find those parts of the game all that enjoyable - if they do a sequel I'd love to see more of a focus on fighting humans, etc. Those were the battles I enjoyed the most.* Didn't really enjoy the Mothman boss fight - too limited ammo and even with cloaking you can't really hide very well; kinda reiterates my feelings that I'd prefer to see more combat against humans rather than monsters.* Combat is pretty frantic - think a combination of the original FEAR + Doom Eternal and that's what you'll have - the enemies move really friggin' fast and it's just a chaotic fight, particularly when monsters are involved. The human combat is a lot better. I think the game could benefit from a little bit of a slow-down in that respect to make it a little more enjoyable and less crazy. I enjoy the fast paced combat in Doom, but in that game, the combat area is exponentially larger and you have things like gravity launchers making it so you can fly across the map whenever you need to put a little distance between you and the enemies and you can't really do that in this game - a brief cloaking device is all you really have and when I say brief, I mean brief - like a few seconds or so and it takes a while to recharge, and then lim - sorry can't finish the review due to 403 errors on Metacritic.

Some moments might be something you've seen before, or something similar. I would not personally compare it to the game F.E.A.R. however in case a remake/remaster were to be made, I am sure this studio could pull it off. If you don't care about a plot or an actual story but love mindless shooting, you should try it out TREPANG2 for yourself. I find the checkpoint system on point. I give it a 7 out of 10 because I think they could've done more than they did, especially with the ""plot"", could've flashed it out more. graphics are fine. there are some minor hiccups here and there with light bugs or glitches that (most of the time) can be fixed by rebooting the game or just reloading the game.",Average

Playing especially on the harder difficulties highlights some clever enemy AI and forces you to use just about every option in your arsenal, and the fact that the game allows you to toss a grenade in slow motion and shoot it in the air to cause a massive explosion should really be all you need to know to learn whether you’ll enjoy Trepang2 or not.

When I’m playing through their short, but extremely boring and tedious segments of either: running away from monsters, or trying to battle a layered and superficial stealth system that doesn’t really work, I’m thinking about quitting it. I guess you could say that the game nails the action and combat, but fails miserably in its horror elements; the horror segments of this game are juvenile, shallow, boring, and cliché. There’s even a segment that relies on a popular meme for a locale for some reason. Having said that, the missions in between, which for the most part are more action oriented and cheesy, are really, really good. This is mainly because the shooting and gameplay of Trepang2 is fantastic; you can juggle enemies in the air, activate slow motion, use invisibility for short windows of opportunity to try and reload your weapons, catch your breath, stuff like that. It’s difficult to describe, but every element in the combat, mechanic wise and in presentation, works in a pristine way, the weapons are fun to use, although I do wish there had been more variety in which ones do you get and when; there’s this really cool nail gun akin to the F.E.A.R. one from Monolith (for obvious reasons, considering how much the game borrows from that title) but here it has a pretty cool gimmick, it makes it so the nails blow up after a getting stuck in the enemies… There’s also the fact that you can customize your weapons, and later on into the game -about halfway through-, you’ll even get the ability to dual wield most of them; it’s pretty cool. The weapon parts that let you customize them are obtained by exploring the levels, they’re in these yellowish boxes you can find from time to time, they slightly alter some of the stats of your guns, but for the most part is just fun to get them in order to watch your weapon turn into a different one. The big problem like I said, it’s the pacing, some might also bring up the length, but at four hours and 25 dollars, I’m not sure if this is a problem, the game is highly repayable considering you can keep all of your weapon parts and dual wielding abilities and replay through any mission you like; there are also cheat codes that alter the game in significant ways, but regrettably, most of these are locked behind completing missions on harder settings, some of the highest difficulty settings even warn you, “…Our publisher told us to remove this difficulty”. Maybe they should’ve listened, after a while it doesn’t become too fun to try and play such an action oriented and fast paced title at such a high difficulty setting, the game itself in the menu tells you “You’ll have to master every mechanic and cheese every encounter”; I’m paraphrasing, but I do remember the “cheese” part, mainly because of how strange it seemed to add a difficulty that even to the developers -implicitly-seemed unfair and unfun. Overall, I was happy with my time with the game, I thought the story was good, although most of it is told through intel files that you gathered through the levels, some of these files are accompanied by images, some of which can be pretty gruesome, others intriguing. The issue here comes from the pacing and the sacrifice of personal ideas; everything that Trepang2 does well, is its own, the devs took inspiration from F.E.A.R. but build on top of the combat systems and gameplay elements from that game, this sadly didn’t extend to the horror elements however, the horror here seemed to rely in memes and cheap jump scares that don’t frighten as much as feel as pandering, every time I dealt with one of those sequences I wanted to go back to the awesome gunplay. It's also a fairly confusing game story wise though, the story has some good elements but the conclusion doesn’t pay off and it frankly feels rushed and filled with loopholes, the type of thing that tried to string too many elements that didn’t really have any connection to one another, I enjoyed it, but I digress, it does have its issues and ends up feeling hollow in a lot of aspects.",Average

4139,amnesia-the-bunker,14-Jul-23,7,"While never being the biggest Amnesia franchise fan, as a horror lover, I was looking forward to this one. The premise is great, you are alone in a creepy World War 1 bunker and need to find the way out. Why are you here? Who brought you? Where is everybody else? What the hell is that noise? The bunker is not big and has four main areas that you can explore. You can find scrap, craft helpful items and piece the story together through notes and pictures. Which leads me to my biggest gripe as a story person. Making sense of the story while being constantly hunted by the monster was more annoying than fun. If the generator goes out and you have no light, good luck, you will miss important items. After a few monster deaths the tension is kind of gone and I started sprinting through the bunker while I had light.",Average

4141,amnesia-the-bunker,3-Jul-23,6,"One of the best atmospheric games I have played, Amnesia: The Bunker truly captures the essence of a haunting and eerie environment. Most games overlook the importance of atmosphere, but this game revolves around it. Picture yourself trapped underground in a bunker, where there is no source of daylight. Complete darkness engulfs you, leaving you with only the eerie sounds of your surroundings. This game nails that unsettling feeling perfect. It's dark AF, and it sends chills down your spine. What impressed me the most is the level of detail put into the audio design. Every step you take, every object you interact with, and even the slightest touch you feel in the game creates an immersive soundscape. It's the little things that count, and this game excels at capturing the subtleties. The minimalistic audio amplifies the creepiness factor, making it an unforgettable experience. Nowadays, games often struggle to strike the right balance between handholding and leaving players lost. However, Amnesia: The Bunker finds the perfect equilibrium. I never felt lost or confused; the game subtly guides you towards your goal without spoon-feeding you. It encourages exploration through the discovery of notes that reveal the secrets of the bunker. It's a prime example of how to engage players without handholding, and it's executed flawlessly. Now, let's talk about the main monster. It's been praised for its advanced AI, but I didn't find it as challenging as expected. The patterns and movements of the monster are quite predictable, especially when the generator is running. As long as you avoid making loud sounds, the monster usually stays hidden. However, there was one encounter that felt genuinely terrifying and unpredictable, possibly due to a bug. It caught me off guard, emphasizing the true fear lurking in the darkness. Nonetheless, once the generator runs out of fuel and darkness sets in, the monster becomes much more relentless, forcing you to tread carefully. Keeping the generator fueled adds a strategic element and makes the game reasonably manageable. While Amnesia: The Bunker doesn't provide an intricate in-game story, it compensates with its intriguing lore. For a game of this nature, the lore was sufficient to keep me engaged. However, it would have been a pleasant addition if it had some connection to their other game, ""Soma."" Nevertheless, the game's focus on survival and the intense cat-and-mouse gameplay with the monster outweighs the need for an elaborate story.",Average

You can't take your time to figure out the puzzles. You gotta go back to the main room to look at the map, you have to know EXACTLY where you are going. GOOD LUCK PLAYING WITHOUT A WALKTHROUGH.

4147,amnesia-the-bunker,21-Jun-23,9,"The Best In The Series Amnesia: The Bunker is truly a return to form for the Amnesia series as a whole in my opinion. Having played Dark Descent when I was still a kid, a Machine for Pigs and a bit of Rebirth, I can wholeheartedly say that The Bunker is like the Dark Descent but significantly better. A lot of people have have rose tinted glasses for Dark Descent and that's fine, it's still a phenomenal game in its own right, but for a modern audience and the strides they've made for the Beast AI that hunts you down in the Bunker, it's truly an amazing piece of art. Amnesia: The Bunker is a survival horror game set in 1916 in the French trenches during World War 1. Like previous titles, your character doesn't know what has happened beforehand and has to navigate their way through the French bunker alone to try and find an escape. There are multiple ways to solve a lot of the puzzles and there are plenty of areas for you to explore but the Beast is always nearby. One of my favourite parts of the game is keeping the generator working, the Beast tends to come out less when the lights are on but it requires fuel which isn't exactly in abundance, a fun part of the game for me was managing when to go out in the dark and when to put the generator on. You do have a gun in The Bunker and it has some use, with diminishing returns, but I found it just made me -feel- safe rather than actually making me safe. The sound and level design is great, it's definitely a game for headphones, playing it through speakers will put you at a disadvantage since your headphones can track which direction the Beast is lurking. Story-telling in the game is a lot more passive, you'll find notes and documents everywhere which helps create the world a little bit better from before the Beasts attack, to just afterwards. This might not be for everyone, as you can play the game without knowing any of the context from start to finish but if you're into finding out more, then the notes are all there. Amnesia: The Bunker is a true return in my opinion for the Amnesia franchise, this game is genuinely horrifying and although it's not super long, because of the randomisation aspects of items etc in the game, it does have replayability. The game will have you tense and on the edge of your seat the entire time. Don't be afraid to gaslight yourself into thinking you can take the beast head on if running for a room if you've been stuck in a corner scared for well over fifteen minutes. Overall, Amnesia: The Bunker is a true horror game and deserves an abundance of praise, if you like horror, if you like genuinely feeling on edge and scared. You'll love this game. 9/10 - As if the horrors of World War 1 weren't bad enough on their own terms.",Positive

Gameplay part is kinda similar to that i saw in previous parts (may be some amnesia funs can decline this)here we got some resource management with not bad stealth system. Sound part on high level you can truly feel how beast and rats clatter their claws behind the walls of the bunker and feel the enemy breath. Visual part it no so great, it's on ""OK"" level it looks practically the same as in previous game (so not the good aspect in terms of evolution in game development). The last aspect of the game is the story, and it's pretty simple here, but I think that's fine for the amount of time you spend playing through the game, the story itself is fed through all sorts of notes.

And sometimes it might even make sense to simply run for it. Everything is a calculated risk. You'll push your luck too much sometimes. And then you'll learn from it, go back and try again. The cool thing is that you rarely get frustrated with it as the game doesn't punish you too much for dying.

Not that story heavy but very, VERY HORROR HEAVY. The original Amnesia was scary, but this is on a whole new level. The AI is not scripted most of the part. it listens to your movements. You make some noise, it hears it. Even just trying to open a door and realizing, it's locked, you are in danger. It might heard it. The flashlight... a WW1 dynamo flashlight, it's noisy and doesn't last long but you can use it anytime you want to... Did I say it hears EVERYTHING? Yep... even the flashlight, even the small debris on the ground... everything is physics based like in other Frictional Games, so move things slowly, carefully.The atmosphere is just depressing. WW1 bunker with dead bodies, generator with little fuel, a freakin' monster that you can defend against but can't kill, yeah you have gun and grenades and stuff, VERY limited number and inventory management is key here. ONE safe room, no auto saves. Highest difficulty is the most stressful experience I've ever head. I though Alien: Isolation can't be topped, but this game did.To be fair, it's a short game, depends on how many minutes you spend on changing pants and sitting in a corner crying.It has mod support, coming with the modding tools, also Steam Workshop is enabled too.Amazing game, Frictional Games topped their previous games in term of horror. Yes, SOMA was an absolute masterpiece in its genre. Yes, the original Amnesia was fantastic and still is. This game clearly is on the lower budget side but also the price tag is much lower than usual too. Incredible experience, a must play for horror fans.

This game focuses on what made the first Amnesia great, namely the dynamic and frightening gameplay, and expands on that with a semi-open world, crafting and weapons. This means more freedom in how you tackle the game. It is quite terrifying overall, with simple but effective graphics and immersive audio that had me on the edge of my seat. The developers doesn't hold the player's hand with tutorials, but rather lets me explore and figure out stuff on my own. Immersion seems to have been key here and it succeeds most of the time. However, there are some downsides. The controls are a bit clunky and the gameplay and how the story is presented feels a bit dated and un-immersive in some ways. For example, the game pauses when you bring up the inventory, reading texts etc. Sure, the game would perhaps have been frustrating if not paused as it is designed now, but this can be overcome with smart design. Furthermore, while you often can tackle obstacles in different ways, sometimes things that you think would work, doesn't. But overall, a good and really scary game.",Average
4160,amnesia-the-bunker,9-Jun-23,8,"Finally, a horror game that doesn't rely on ridiculous jumpscares to frighten players, but instead focuses on incredible sound design and a highly unsettling and claustrophobic atmosphere.I must admit, discovering that I'm French was the most terrifying part of the game. Unfortunately, the game has a rather short duration, and I completed it in about 5 hours. However, these 5 hours felt like an eternity due to the constant presence of an entity moving through the walls and corridors, creating a constant feeling of being watched by the monster. One of the interesting aspects of the game is the need to keep the lights constantly on by refueling the generator to avoid being violently attacked by the dear monster, as we discover that it cannot tolerate light. A new addition compared to previous Amnesia titles is that we are finally armed with a pistol, shotgun, and various types of grenades, which not only allow us to defend ourselves against the monster but can also be used as tools to progress in the bunker. For example, we can shoot locks to open doors or use the shotgun to blast through wooden doors. A technical standpoint, the game is well-optimized. I was able to run it smoothly on my GTX 1080, although it would have been appreciated to unlock the refresh rate, currently limited to 60. Fortunately, it is possible to manually modify some configuration files to change it. However, I want to emphasize that increasing the refresh rate may cause issues in the game.

4165,amnesia-the-bunker,8-Jun-23,9,"Simply phenomenal. This new installment is a great improvement over the previous Amnesia. Frictional has managed to create a game that has a captivating and interesting story but also a fun gameplay loop that will keep you on your toes. The plot follows a WW1 soldier that is desperately trying to escape a horrifying bunker that is home to a terrifying yet mysterious monster. The player must use his intelligence, wits, and decision-making to progress through the game. Equipped with an innovative tool, the dynamo-flashlight, he can traverse the bunker and see in the dark. However, the sound the flashlight makes can also alert the beast.The atmosphere paired with the graphical innovations lead to a recipe made in heaven. The howling hallways and the constant movement of the monster WILL give you goosebumps. The beast's AI always knows your location and will not stop until it finds you and tears you to shreds.Avoiding it sure is a challenge but it can be accomplished. Traversing through the bunker, you must crouch, avoid traps/rats, explosions, and calculate every move to stay alive. Adding to the terror is the inclusion of a generator that keeps electricity running through the bunker. When the generator eventually runs out of fuel, something that will inevitably happen, you are at the mercy of the monster.The beast is stronger, faster, and more terrifying without any source of light so you MUST keep the generator running no matter the cost. Furthermore, the bunker is a semi-open-world environment and, as a result, you can choose what and where to explore first.Overall, Amnesia: The Bunker is an amazing experience and, although short at around 4-6 hours of playtime, it immerses the player and requires critical thinking and smart decision-making to complete which, in my opinion, makes it an unforgettable adventure.",Positive

Compelling mystery accompanied by a suitably haunting aesthetic and sharp sound design. Bad-Controls can feel a bit clunky at first. Some situations necessitate trial and error, which can lead to some frustration. Not very long, and not much narrative incentive to replay aside from attempting a harder difficulty. Thoughts-While it doesn’t rewrite the book on horror, Amnesia: The Bunker is good at what it does, presenting a unique scenario for players to overcome and the tools to incentivize experimentation.

4171,vengeful-guardian-moonrider,26-Jan-23,6,"Олдскулы не свело Vengeful Guardian: Moonrider — новый проект от создателей Blazing Chrome. Если в прошлый раз разработчики выбрали в качестве главного вдохновителя Contra Hard Coprs, то на этот раз они явно поглядывали в сторону старенького Shinobi III: Return of the Ninja Master и подобных экшен платформеров из 16-битной эпохи. Ностальгия забавная вещь, она может сглаживать острые углы старых воспоминаний, приукрашивая всё что с нами происходило много лет назад. Но в тоже время мы можем забывать про негативные аспекты или неприятные моменты. В отношении игр это работает схожим образом. Пелена ностальгических очков спадает и магия перестаёт работать. Именно такая ситуация случилась с Vengeful Guardian: Moonrider. Мы играем за механического ниндзю, который просыпается в камере и начинает резать на фарш врагов и всех, кто встанет у него на пути. Из арсенала только клинок для ближнего боя, но по ходу прохождения дадут несколько дополнительных способностей. Выбираем уровень как в «Контре», доходим до конца, побеждаем босса, переходим на следующий этап и так до конца. Игра очень простая даже для новичков, а кто закален олдскулом, то не встретит в ней никаких сложностей за всё 2-3 часовое прохождение, вынося всех боссов с 1-2 попыток. Почти в самом начале дают навык, сильно облегчающий жизнь игроку. Создатели явно прогадали с балансом. С графикой и музыкой тоже не все гладко. Пиксель арт вполне сносный, но в глаза бросаются очень топорные анимации, деревянные движения врагов, главного героя и боссов. Доходит порой до смешного и ловишь себя на мысли, что игра 30 летней давности (тот самый Shinobi III на Sega Genesis) выглядит и звучит лучше проекта, вышедшего в 2023 году. Это печалит. Вот и остаётся только умиляться отсылкам на старые хиты индустрии. Тут у нас стена с пушками преграждает путь как в Contra, вот побег от поднимающейся лавы как в Ninja Gaiden, а теперь в нас стреляют с заднего плана на передний как в Shinobi. Более менее запоминается и хоть немного выделяется эпизод с покатушками на мотоцикле. Но как было сказано выше, ностальгия работает в обе стороны и многим этого будет достаточно, не зря на данный момент Лунный Наездник находится на первой строчке Metacritic и OpenCritic за 2023 год на всех платформах. Естественно, игр толком никаких ещё не вышло и поэтому пока имеем что имеем. Кому понравится:- Кто хочет вспомнить детство и кто любит ретро игры. Кому не понравится:- Кто застал времена NES, Sega Genesis и хочет чего-то большего, чем простой ностальгии.- Кто не переваривает слишком крупные пиксели. Итог: Это просто обычный боевой 2D платфрмер, который делает референсы в сторону хитов старой эпохи и в этом его главная ошибка. Он делает референсы, но не старается быть лучше или хотя бы сравниться с играми на которые ровняется. Кому-то будет достаточного и этого.",Average

4177,one-piece-odyssey,23-Jan-23,6,"Never saw the anime. One Piece Odyssey is a RPG like Dragonquest in looks, but with less flair in gameplay. The story is average at first, and becomes more solid after 20 hours. Which is a long time to get bored. Sadly the game puts dialogues almost everywhere. The most annoying are in fights. I like voice over but to hear the same thing a zillion times is not fun. A lot of useless, useless cut scenes. I like the exploration part of it. You can create food, items, accessories. Although the clothing is really empty. The combat is super easy, and becomes a bit harder after 20 hours. You really have to use Autocombat because there is too many of them. Even the auto feature, reduce fighting time, a lot but spend loads of magic. It was clearly aimed at, not be too hard for kids. The graphics are cartoonist. I especially dislike how women are excessively exaggerated. One region, the water temple, is difficult to navigate. Otherwise, I did enjoy the exploration power, the memory area, the hysteria stuff. And yah, you have to do saving points a lot. Fast travel is there but the game keep turning the option off, unless you complete a world. It is really frustrating. Voices are decent in Japanese, you get English subtitles only. I give it 65%. I am around 23 hours, nearing the ending. Some parts are fun, some not so much. And it's hard to understand how they couldn't construct this with a bit more balance and better gaming. And I find it hard to recommend it, because it's a love/hate kind of deal.",Average

4179,one-piece-odyssey,19-Jan-23,8,"Original review was a 6, however with the movement speed and difficulty mods, two of my big issues with the game have been addressed. Another complaint I had originally was the lack of auto saves. However the game does autosave, but the devs made it hidden. On the start screen where you go and choose your save, scroll up and you’ll see an autosave option. The game has an awesome combat system which unfortunately gets overshadowed by the easy difficulty, but has now been addressed with awesome mods. The story has me intrigued as an OP fan and the devs have managed to capture the chemistry between the strawhats perfectly! The music is great and likewise the visuals too! Although I would’ve preferred if they had went with cellshading, but nonetheless no major complaints here! The movement speed in the game is too slow however again, has been addressed with mods. My main gripe now is the constant black screens. Go the wrong way, fade to black screen. Swap characters, fade to black screen. Love the cutscenes, however at many points, they would occur almost back to back. So you might come out of a cutscene, walk a bit to another place, and then another cutscene plays. They should’ve been a bit more spaced out. The modding potential alone makes this game triumph all previous OP games. The devs need to just work on constant black screens and this game could be a 9.",Positive

Rpg combat mechanics are basic, I dont think there is a way to lose battles so far, perhaps engaging for people new to the rpg turn based genre?

You walk down a long path, fighting random enemies on the way with very simple and easy combat. It is the most barebones combat you can have in a JRPG. Outside of the prologue, it still feels like you're in the prologue, waiting for it to get to the point. The character models look souless. Luffy looks like a doll.

4195,might-&-magic-clash-of-heroes---definitive-edition,14-Dec-20,7,"I enjoyed the game, but it's not at all what was advertised. We were told it was going to be a deep RPG with immersion as good as RDR2, well that obviously didn't happen. It's buggy and glitchy, yes, and it doesn't run well for most people unless you have a NASA computer, but those things can be fixed and actually don't factor into my review of the game in the slightest. My biggest issue with the game is that it's entirely superficial, the world is big and looks beautiful but where are the things to do besides shooting people? I was expecting mini games, something like Gwent, or brain dances, hell, Wakako has a pachinko parlor, why can't we use it? Cutting hair, getting piercings, tattoos? None of it. Then there is the AI, and I can't believe a game released in 2020 with an AI system like this. The police outright spawn behind you, there is no chase system, no wanted system, no corrupt rich and powerful to send the police as their own personal hitmen, all things that were promised. Run away from the police after gaining a star? It's like they've never seen you before. But if you stand too close to them? They shoot you. There really isn't much things to do except things involving combat, and while combat is fun, it's not really all that fun to do it over and over again. I wanted to enjoy the city, not just the combat. Hacking is okay, but a little boring. Same with stealth. Personal story also has very little impact on the game, I remember they were planning to add in a whole ""traumatic life experiences"", ""childhood hero"" etc, but all of that got scrapped. It makes your beginning of nomad, corpo or street kid feel hollow except for the occasional dialogue option that honestly doesn't change much. And what was with the montage at the beginning? Why couldn't we experience those times with Jackie? Would've made him and events of the story surrounding him much more compelling since, ya know, we'd actually have time to get to know him. You could've showed us, not told us. Something I can say about the game though is that the characters are very well written. Honestly it's the cast that really drive this game, their growth and depth are really well done and CDPR did a great job of making me hate, then love, then love-hate, then love again a certain character. But I'm a little pissed extra special attention was given to Judy and Panam, while Kerry and River took the backseat by being entirely easy to miss by being tied to side quests, unlike our ladies. Give a little love to our homies, CDPR. Which also brings me to the point of why the heck did they censor all the dongs in the game? It was there in the tech demo. Full frontal nudity is okay for women, but not for men? Give me a break, this is a bleak as heck world, a scrapper wouldn't have the courtesy to leave a man's underwear on if they only viewed them as meat and valuable tech. I also want to bring up the endings, I won't spoil anything but I can say I don't particularly like any of them, and again, they favor the girl romances in certain endings. I really, really hate open ended endings that tease things ""oo, maybe a dlc? maybe not? maybe a 2nd title?"". It's lazy, annoying, and doesn't really give me a sense of closure. And anyone saying ""happy endings, in a cyberpunk setting?"" yes, happy endings. Things that reward the player. I'm sick of games lately adding numerous endings but they're all just different variations of bad ends. It ruins the journey in my opinion.",Average

Por un lado es un juego narrativo, con buenos personajes, bien llevados y con muchas conversaciones y decisiones que ir tomando que marcan las muchas maneras en que la historia puede progresar. Me hubieran gustado más conversaciones, sin duda, pero al final siempre se quiere más. La otra cara de la moneda es un juego de gestión de recursos en el que asignar nuestra tripulación a distintas tareas para garantizar nuestra supervivencia en el hielo. Es una jugabilidad un poco sencilla de más, pero cumple bien con lo que pretende como complemento a la parte narrativa. Todo ello junto realmente nos transporta a una situación muy dura, en medio del polo sin prácticamente recursos y donde tomar muchas decisiones que determinan quienes viven o mueren. Hay momentos en que hasta se siente el frío. A nivel gráfico el juego no es excelente pero si tiene una ejecución muy eficaz y con mucha personalidad propia. El sonido es un apartado discreto en principio pero los efectos sonoros están bien hechos y la música cumple muy bien, apareciendo en momentos contados para aportar un extra de atmósfera que funciona. Es cierto que al principio tuvo unos cuantos bugs, aunque la verdad es que el equipo los ha ido puliendo y yo la verdad es que no me he tropezado con casi ninguno. Por todo ello, aunque no es perfecto, The Pale Beyond sí que es un juego especial y diferente.

Communist oppressive regime – check.Basically everything was ripped off shamelessly, including the symbol of the ficticious country we are serving. Arstozka or Arcaristan. Even the name sounds the same. Now, what do we do?We do the same old. Checking cars, cargo and people. We make sure everything is in order, while the game keeps distracting us from actually trying to do that. While the original put us into the daily grind at our desk and establishes a sense of familiarity and repetitveness, contraband police seems to want to force us into an action packed open world experience with an exciting story, car chases, gun fights and all sorts of badly programmed nonsense. The driving is awful, the gun fights as well. I stopped caring about the story quickly, cause its just another opressor / resistance sheme and it’s not done well enough to keep my attention. The constant distraction wouldn’t be such a problem if it was actually fun. But it’s not. And I felt bombarded with phone calls, „opportunities“, attacks on the border station, driving prisoners to the labor camp through ambushes, having to maintain ammunition, vehicles and tools that break after a couple of days and all sorts of other things, while having to take care of daily border business, which is also constantly changing. I just want your papers, please..

4212,contraband-police,14-Mar-23,7,"What a pleasant surprise. The immediate comparison in mind is obviously to Papers Please, but this is far greater in scope. Think Papers Please mixed with My Summer Car, or any other solid indie “life simulator”. Its far more than just checking documents as you do in Papers Please, it goes far deeper in terms of gameplay mechanics and moral choices. While each of the gameplay mechanics are very different in terms of quality and execution, they flow extremely well together and compliment one another. For example the transition from very well refined document/cargo inspection to a relatively unpolished shooting sequence is still an excellent variety of gameplay, even if some of the other sequences aren’t as great. Then your performance is rewarded with money, which can be used to purchase equipment/upgrades for you to do your job better, or some minor luxuries. The moral choices are cool but poorly executed. Granted I think this will be ironed out in time, but it almost feels kind of pointless doing anything other than the moral choice, simply because the moral choice pays so well. Once they balance some of the economics of the game, I think this will better highlight the moral choices. One unfortunate thing about the game is that once you figure out the formula of who to search and where to search, it loses a lot of its magic. Its a game that is best played going in blind. The presentation is far from perfect, but good enough to get the job done. Given the size of the studio that made the game, it’s very impressive. But objectively, the graphics and the sound is good enough. The animations are pretty rigid as well. The core enjoyment is the detailed oriented gameplay. I am enjoying this game, and I am excited to see what is in store for the future. I hope more people give it a chance, because there are a lot of hours of fun to be had here.

4222,crime-o'clock,1-Jan-21,10,I was able to enjoy this game throughout my play. The main quest is a bit short but the side quests are humorous and exciting so I still felt engaged. It does feel like there are some things missing such as car customization but as far as gameplay I never felt limited by the system. What was amazing was how being caught in a mission created a huge car chase that I didn't quite make it out of. I then replayed the mission and got through stealthily and things changed massively. I have experienced the many glitches of but they get better and things run smoothly. In a month all of the major issues will likely be gone.,Positive
4223,crime-o'clock,17-Dec-20,10,the game on the XSX runs quite well reaching already 60+ fps due to the hotfix 1.0.4 which fixed mainly all bugs. overall playing the game i feel the story i quite well driven. panam is a great addition to the game and relationship life.. the emotional significance in the game is quite high the scenery words and mood of the characters  did not feel cold or fake or even robotic.. strangely it felt perfectly coded to look very!! human. i love the human feel of the game unlike the cartoonish grand theft auto franchise. ps4 ass lickers are already giving this lovely game a bad review.. when on the ps5 and XSX it runs to the likes of a rtx 2060 super or above.. quite disappointed in playstation for removing it from the PS Store. i hope to god xbox doesn't do that if they do i might as well sell my xbox as Cyberpunk is the most TRUE immersive video game unlike the fake and cartoony GTA which runs on 30fps and terrible resolution still on next-gen. shame on rockstar for not having a next gen update for that. back to the point the game will not make you bored.. a lovely rpg game where you can make the world you want to live in. quite a fun game to play and an overall 10 rating from me. love to the developers.. sorry the hype ruined the launch but it is what it is. **** the ps4 and OG Xbox mofos who wanna give this game a bad review. **** the media for jumping on the bandwagon and putting the CD Projeckt Red team.. and **** the Metacritic critics because they're either playing on OG Xbox or base ps4.. and anyone who hates the game just because they don't have a next gen or a good pc an dis jumping on the bandwagon **** on this beautiful masterpiece of a game,Positive

Decisions feel like they have real weight.The only downsides are a cluttered menu, no 3rd person, no post-beginning customization of your ""V"" and no customizing the vehicles. Had a few minor bugs but nothing game-breaking.",Positive
4225,crime-o'clock,14-Dec-20,7,"I enjoyed the game, but it's not at all what was advertised. We were told it was going to be a deep RPG with immersion as good as RDR2, well that obviously didn't happen. It's buggy and glitchy, yes, and it doesn't run well for most people unless you have a NASA computer, but those things can be fixed and actually don't factor into my review of the game in the slightest. My biggest issue with the game is that it's entirely superficial, the world is big and looks beautiful but where are the things to do besides shooting people? I was expecting mini games, something like Gwent, or brain dances, hell, Wakako has a pachinko parlor, why can't we use it? Cutting hair, getting piercings, tattoos? None of it. Then there is the AI, and I can't believe a game released in 2020 with an AI system like this. The police outright spawn behind you, there is no chase system, no wanted system, no corrupt rich and powerful to send the police as their own personal hitmen, all things that were promised. Run away from the police after gaining a star? It's like they've never seen you before. But if you stand too close to them? They shoot you. There really isn't much things to do except things involving combat, and while combat is fun, it's not really all that fun to do it over and over again. I wanted to enjoy the city, not just the combat. Hacking is okay, but a little boring. Same with stealth. Personal story also has very little impact on the game, I remember they were planning to add in a whole ""traumatic life experiences"", ""childhood hero"" etc, but all of that got scrapped. It makes your beginning of nomad, corpo or street kid feel hollow except for the occasional dialogue option that honestly doesn't change much. And what was with the montage at the beginning? Why couldn't we experience those times with Jackie? Would've made him and events of the story surrounding him much more compelling since, ya know, we'd actually have time to get to know him. You could've showed us, not told us. Something I can say about the game though is that the characters are very well written. Honestly it's the cast that really drive this game, their growth and depth are really well done and CDPR did a great job of making me hate, then love, then love-hate, then love again a certain character. But I'm a little pissed extra special attention was given to Judy and Panam, while Kerry and River took the backseat by being entirely easy to miss by being tied to side quests, unlike our ladies. Give a little love to our homies, CDPR. Which also brings me to the point of why the heck did they censor all the dongs in the game? It was there in the tech demo. Full frontal nudity is okay for women, but not for men? Give me a break, this is a bleak as heck world, a scrapper wouldn't have the courtesy to leave a man's underwear on if they only viewed them as meat and valuable tech. I also want to bring up the endings, I won't spoil anything but I can say I don't particularly like any of them, and again, they favor the girl romances in certain endings. I really, really hate open ended endings that tease things ""oo, maybe a dlc? maybe not? maybe a 2nd title?"". It's lazy, annoying, and doesn't really give me a sense of closure. And anyone saying ""happy endings, in a cyberpunk setting?"" yes, happy endings. Things that reward the player. I'm sick of games lately adding numerous endings but they're all just different variations of bad ends. It ruins the journey in my opinion.",Average

4234,tchia,23-Mar-23,10,"Tchia is a beautiful game to sit down and explore for hours.There’s a lot of room for improvement which is a good thing when the first instalment into Awaceb’s small studio has already ticked many boxes that a lot of games don’t. Graphics: For its style it’s perfect, Zelda is the closest thing and I’d lean on BotW and Wind Waker the most. The sea looks incredible and you can explore it in many ways. The raft is a one man Sea of Thieves pirate ship where you can drop your anchor at anytime, adjust your sail for speed and hop off and warp into a bunch of animals to go exploring or deep sea diving. The lighting is exceptional, seeing the sun illuminate the clouds in front of it in any location of each island is a sight to behold if you can kick back and be adventurous. Music score: Award worthy. The music is both true to the games feel and if you’re like me you can get lost in it so easily. It has the perfect blend of paradise and wonder mixed with a family party vibe depending on your location and activity you’re currently doing. I’d be more amazed if you haven’t already noticed it fits well and isn’t just a cheap gimmicky soundtrack thrown together unrelated to the games atmosphere.Innovation ideas: While BotW has new ways for combat and play style using the slate, Tchia has the ability to transform yourself into a number of items/ objects and animals to mimic their movements or if it’s an object then you can see how good the physics are. Room for improvement on some of these but still it’s a step in the right direction. Flying around as a bird exploring the islands is the best feature, I’m not too far in to say the soul jumping will later last as long as you want but I sure hope we can and also glide without a stamina bar too. That will keep me playing for longer if so.Enemies & Story: I am very early stages into the game but so far the gangs of enemies are easy to take out, the main bad guy had a great introduction and better than my favourite Little Big Planet game which was 2. It grabbed my attention even though he squashed a crab which got my back up a little after the loveable one from the trailers but I’ll get my revenge later on I’m sure. Currently I’m too engrossed swinging off trees/ flying around, climbing buildings and jumping off. I’ve got to go back for my trophies which I left at my house to play the claw machine. Im loving the customisable outfits which are plenty! More to come tomorrow and especially over the weekend when I have more downtime but I’m already practicing melodies for a cool video cut I’ll post at the weekend. Review Score: I feel Tchia deserves a solid 8, anything lower than a 7 comes down to subjective reviews but anything lower than a 5 isn’t appreciating the work that has gone into this game and it isn’t a broken mess. So 6+ review scores are low but believable, 7-8 is where it’s at. I would top it to a 9 simply for the awesome soundtrack and pure passion project this has clearly been. It’s been my most wanted game for a long time and I hope the team work on a sequel to this over Sifu/ Scorn or any other that Kepler their parent company has made. Tchia is the crown, Sifu is the wearer and Scorn… won’t ruin my review. 10/10 from me for pure hope that this game receives a follow up. I’ve downloaded for free via PS+ Extra and bought it to help the developers as much as I can. Yes I’m the guy on Twitter who’s been liking each post for 2 years now and to everyone on the Awaceb team my hats off to you!",Positive

4275,atomic-heart,4-Jun-23,5,"If I were to describe ""Atomic Heart"" accurately, I would dub it the 'Illusion Fair'. Despite having a genuinely short game length, it crafts the illusion of an open world that convinces you of a lengthy adventure ahead. The NPCs never let up, and the game's difficulty level, even on the easiest mode, is exorbitantly high. This robs many players of their peace and increases stress levels. The scarcity of save points just adds salt to these wounds. I am at ease that I played this game via Xbox Game Pass, as I was contemplating buying it directly. But this should be evaluated in the context of my subjective opinion and gaming taste. If you're a ""Doom"" aficionado and love run-and-gun style games, this could be heaven for you.

4285,atomic-heart,27-May-23,2,"Можете закидать меня помидорами, но единственное самое лучшее в этой игре - атмосфера.Персонажи в игре ни чем не запоминаются (разве что баба Зина со своим юмором и не более). Остальные персонажи являются какими-то пустыми, на которых попросту все равно. Зафоршенные близняшки своей красотой не могут давать + балл к оценке игры только потому, что они красивые.Сюжет показался мне не интересным и уж через чур переполненным всякой информацией, которая спустя одного часа игры становится понятной. Но до конца игры нас все пичкают одной и той жей инфой, что начинает надоедать.По поводу геймплея. Бесконечные одни и те же муторные локации со врагами отличающиеся только текстурами. Одни и те же враги, то же самое оружие, все одно и то же. Какие-то навыки к скиллам которые по сути мало что дают, а сами скиллы практически бесполезны. Напомнило чем-то 1 tlou, где ты рубишь тонну врагов, а после продолжается повествование, но перепичканый всякими скиллами и навыками.Разработчикам, повторюсь, отдельный респект за атмосферу и саму идею, но как по мне, оценка 2.

You get a silly dodge which often gets you stuck in some textures after performing it, weapons doesn't feel that great and also the bosses design is pretty bad. Don't even make me start on the story and character development in this game, and the dumb, cringe and unlikable main character. It's like the story was written in the bathroom break of GoW Ragnarok or somethis is really really awful. Cinematics look funny and not in a good way.

4336,atomic-heart,22-Apr-23,10,"После множества часов, проведенных в удивительном мире Atomic Heart, я не могу не поделиться своим восторгом от этой великолепной игры. Это произведение искусства превосходит все ожидания и устанавливает новые стандарты для жанра экшн-RPG. С самого начала игры, Atomic Heart завораживает своей атмосферой. Мрачный и таинственный мир постапокалиптического СССР окутан внутренней напряженностью и жутким шармом. Графика поражает своей детализацией, а качество звукового сопровождения погружает игрока в опасный и неизведанный мир. Сюжет игры захватывает с первых минут. Ваш персонаж, сотрудник спецслужб, становится свидетелем масштабной катастрофы, и его главная задача — разобраться в происходящем и найти ответы на множество вопросов. Загадки, интриги и реверсивные моменты вплетены в сюжет так гармонично, что оторваться от игры практически невозможно. Геймплей Atomic Heart предлагает глубокую и продуманную систему боя и прокачки персонажа. Выживание в этом опасном мире требует стратегии, тактики и изобретательности. Арсенал оружия впечатляет разнообразием, а встречи с различными монстрами и противниками становятся настоящим испытанием для игрока. Отдельно стоит упомянуть о превосходном качестве музыкального сопровождения игры. Атмосферные треки и мастерски выполненные звуковые эффекты дополняют впечатление от игры и делают ее еще более захватывающей. Треки из далекого прошлого СССР заставляли меня невольно улыбаться во время прохождения игры. В заключение хочется сказать, что Atomic Heart — это истинное произведение искусства, которое заслуживает внимания каждого ценителя игровой индустрии. Я настоятельно рекомендую погрузиться в этот потрясающий мир и насладиться каждой минутой проведенного времени в игре. P.S.

4344,atomic-heart,11-Apr-23,8,"Throughout the years and before the official release media outlets would write that Atomic Heart would never release and looks too good to be true in the trailers. With multiple games releasing already in 2023 with performance issues and bugs I had surprisingly little problems with this game. An example of how you should not judge a game before release, the negative press was uncalled for. A love letter to Bioshock your first impression is the fantastic world building and environmental storytelling. The second impression is the annoying main character, constantly swearing and arrogant which becomes grating over time. While some dialogue was funny, most of it is childish and I would have wished for a different protagonist. The game itself looks absolutely stunning, the music with a mix of classical and house music (sometimes mixed together) is fantastic and the gunplay serviceable. Playing with a controller on PC some bosses were a bit hard to keep in focus with their fast movements. I thought the upgrade system that returns spent materials if you want to try a different weapon or skill is a great idea. Overall an enjoyable game for fans of Bioshock that does not need to hide behind his inspiration.",Positive

Combat feels good with good gunplay and excellent melee where you slice up machines which looks great. The writing and voice acting are indeed quite bad. But the gameplay is great. Tons of weapon upgrades and character skills to play with.The constantly repairing machines in the open world get annoying, but just don’t get spotted by a camera and if you do, just run for it. It’s a pity the open world wasn’t utilised in a better and in depth way, since it’s stunning to be in but not much to do there. All in all it’s very much worth playing, if they can improve on the writing and story this developer can seriously create something incredible.",Positive

Rtx is really well implemented adding to claustrophobic atmosphere in corridors. For me atmosphere was main driver but building up of character was also adding as well implemented (only that robot was really cheesy with sex allusions).All in all, so far good candidate for one of best games this year and great first game of this dev studio.",Positive

4359,atomic-heart,1-Apr-23,7,"7,3/10Первая AAA от русских разрабов удалась! Далеко не шедевр, многим может не зайти, зачем-то использует куча ""кликбейтного"" пиара, очень ""неровные"" впечатления от неё получаешь, но, тем не менее, это грамотный микс,не выглядит копиркой какой-то определённой игры, имеет уникальные черты.Особо описывать сюжет нету смысла, почему-то русские разрабы всегда бояться сделать что-то серьёзное, как в американских блокбастерах, нет, обязательно надо какой-то веселёнький трешовый трешачок сделать, так же проще - зачем напрягаться в реализм? Просто навалим юмора, плюс тут ещё и очень плохая постановка катсцен, никакого импакта от них не чувствуешь, и также ""умственно отсталый"" главный герой, ну хотя как ещё могли сделать кгб-шника, это не минус, просто к сведению. Тем не менее, я должен отметить очень богатый лор проекта, записек тут.. ух, графомания знатная, конечно, но хоть продумали вселенную. Ну и концовку я, считаю, грамотно сделали. Правда, как же к ней долго подводят, последние сюжетные уровни невероятно сильно душат, дают несколько каких-то однообразных боссов, резко кучу сюжета и записок наваливают,ну ладно, это уже о геймплее,Скажу сразу - он простой, прям очень, челленджа тут не ждите, у вас есть несколько способностей, 2-е на выбор (это щит или заморозка или кинетическое поднимание врагов или полимерный проводник различных эффектов), 1 постоянная - это шок, также у нас 1 ближнее оружие, имеющее сильный и слабый удар, и стандартный набор огнестрела: шотган, пистолет, беск. электрический пистолет, калаш, гаусс-пушка, базука. Дефицита патронов тут нет, каждая способность имеет свой ""кулдаун"".. И, с таким широким арсеналом, я практически не встречал трудностей, даже с толпой противников.. да, враги достаточно быстрые, несутся на тебя уверенно со всей дури, у нас также есть способность рывка в сторону, но, даже на высокой сложности, враги шёлкаются, как орешки, а уж ваншотный гранатомёт.. почти что создаёт имбовый дизбаланс, спасает только то, что патронов на финальных уровнях к нему дают мало, хотя я бы вообще закрыл возможность крафта припасов на него. В общем, куча способностей, тыкая все подряд в бою - при любом сете, вы будете терминатором.Что однозначно круто? Общий арт-дизайн, атмосферные песни Пугачёвой, механика собирания лута.. блин, она невероятная, вы пылесосите перчаткой шкафы и ящики, даже не подходя к ним, анимации выдвижения ящиков не надоедают даже после 20 часов игры, в каждой бы игре с лутом такую механику.. Полное ревью: https://vk.com/uwgcr?w=wall-210200508_730",Average

I couldn't resist anymore the game just makes you do the things you have done again and again and it is trying to do it like you are doing it for the first time. When I deleted the game was the time that i died and saw myself at like the beginning of the 100th same mission and you know how i died? robots just bugged me blocked me i used my telekinesis and those things but... no it did kill me and while i was trying to manage to finish the game and not give up. bro autosave cmon it is 2023,Negative
4363,atomic-heart,29-Mar-23,5,"First and foremost I would encourage you to disregard reviews unspecific about what they enjoyed or did not enjoy — There is probably more positive propaganda from butthurt Russians than negative from SJWs.Pros:1. Soundtrack2. GraphicsCons:1. Not easy to navigate the main quests — objectively frustrating and frequently disrespectful of player time. Bunch of fetch quests in corridor mazes where map/navigation assistance is useless 60% of the time. And that’s probably a generous figure.Also long and completely unskippable dialogues/cinematics.2. Wants to be an action RPG & also a survival game & also a looter shooter & also a walking sim / visual novel? No mechanical synergy, just sh*t thrown at the wall.3. FPS optimized very well, but don’t be fooled by that — it is a very, very glitchy game. Laughed at reviews lauding optimization just because motion is smooth, when you can easily get locked in place by the environment requiring restart in a game that uses save stations…4. ^An action game that uses save stations^5. Combat revolves entirely around crowd controlling brain dead hyper aggressive enemies that, for the most part, just want you in a corner. Reverse difficulty curve isn’t very satisfying in endgame + enemies are all bullet sponges.6. Trying to navigate swimming through polymer7. Not sure if I love or hate the “force pull for loot” mechanic. Might be better with a mouse than controller. Lots of time spent looting… not a lot of loot.Summary:Think of this as an experiment by an indie developer with action that controls like it was designed as a PC or VR game (think subnautica), and you will appreciate what they’ve done here.If you go in expecting a tight shooter looter like borderlands, you will be disappointed.Overall most of the good manifests as unrealized potential. It shows promise as an iterative IP, but it’s hard to recommend the debut in a vacuum.Get this on sale or if your are just mega bored and intrigued by the setting.",Average

They can attack in a crowd and sooner or later you will be left without supplies and die.

I thought ""it can't be that bad, I'm sure I'll still enjoy it"" BOY WAS I WRONG.The setting, graphics and world building are gorgeous, but; - The gameplay is mediocre at best- The dialogue is one step away from terrible- The puzzles are unnecessarily annoying- The crafting is an artificial gameplay extender that adds no value to the game- The guns are almost pointless (at least early on)- The glove won't shutup- The vending machine makes me want to kill myself- The parkour often doesn't work properly- The tutorials pop up during sections where you're repeatedly hitting the space button, so it auto skips them- The rhythm based lockpicking system is the most annoying lockpicking system I've ever seen- The protagonist (and glove) treat you like a 5 year old, that needs everything explained- The port to PC feels like they did literally nothing to make it PC friendly If you like souls-like style gameplay, (I use that relatively loosely) grind-a-thons and games that look beautiful, then you genuinely may love this, but if you're expecting a fast paced, well designed FPS set in an interesting universe, you better hurry along. TLDR; The game is a beautiful looking tedious nightmare that does not deliver AT ALL on the fast paced FPS style aesthetic you might be expecting, they've taken the mediocre parts of several different genres and badly combined them into a painstaking, tedious mess",Negative

4394,atomic-heart,17-Mar-23,10,"Atomic Heart is an absolute masterpiece of a game. As a fan of the first-person shooter genre, I was blown away by the game's graphics, sound design, and gameplay mechanics. The alternate universe Soviet Union setting is both captivating and terrifying, with an array of bizarre and otherworldly creatures to encounter. The game's story is deeply immersive, with a richly detailed world that rewards exploration and discovery.One of the things I appreciated most about Atomic Heart was the sheer variety of gameplay options available. From stealthy takedowns to brutal melee combat, from using guns to wielding special abilities, there is always something new to try. The game's controls are intuitive and responsive, and the level design is both challenging and rewarding.But what really sets Atomic Heart apart is the sheer creativity and ambition of its developers. Mundfish has crafted a game that is both visually stunning and thematically rich, with a level of detail and polish that is truly impressive. Even after completing the game, I find myself returning to it time and again, eager to explore more of its secrets and hidden treasures.Overall, if you're a fan of immersive storytelling, inventive gameplay, and breathtaking visuals, then Atomic Heart is an absolute must-play.

It's barely on par with the first and to even put this game anywhere close to a Fallout game is just nonsense. I have done a few hours, no more. The main character is a complete dick. He is supposed to be an elite professional but is really an unruly 15 year old boy who has an axe and a gun. It's painful listening to him. The RPG elements are a thin veneer of what RPG should be. It is linear and not open world. I know it was not a full OW game but the reality is that this game is not OW at all. Two corridors, one of which is a dead end so you have to go back and do the other one is linear. I thought we were well past such a bore fest.

The story is interesting, the gameplay and skills are fun enough, and the characters are pretty good. If this was an AAA game, this would be a 6, maybe 6.5. But for an ""almost"" indie game?

Mundfish сделали то, чего не смогли многие за последние несколько лет, заинтересовать, ответить за слова и оставить хорошее впечатление. Ведь я покупаю игры не для того чтоб 90+ часов дрочить на что то непонятное , или не ради графона. Я люблю играть, погружаясь в атмосферу и переживать историю, и Mundfish это сделала.

It's not even about the mechanics that we've all seen for a long time in different games like Bioshock, Far cry, etc., but in the game design, the idea, the plot and the embodiment of these mechanics. The game looks very fresh, the character's narrative is perfectly understandable, you want to explore a world full of difficult puzzles and dangerous opponents. In Russian, the game is full of strong obscenities, very funny and vital dialogues, while there is completely no agenda, which is already fed up.",Positive
4443,atomic-heart,5-Mar-23,0,"TL;DR  IMO it's the game of 2023. First time I heard about it, I thought it's going to be yet another B crappy shooter. Ended up a wonderful mix of Bioshock and Fallout. Actually, I liked Atomic Heart more than Bioshock. Finished it and waiting for DLCs. The atmosphere is amazing. Great attention to details, visuals and music. I liked the battle system and upgrades. The best part is, I can experiment with the builds with zero (nada, blizzard etc, nilch) punishment for respecing weapons or my character. Looting system is good too.Bosses aren't that hard, definitely not a Dark Souls PITA. I can kill them in 1-2 tries and move on with the story, and I like it. The game is linear, though. The open world is there but it desperately lacks sidequests. Side-stories are mostly in the form or reading emails, listening to these watches, and talking to dead bodies. I'd recommend not to miss any and remember them as they help to put together the quite a convoluted story and atmosphere. Devs are very active in the forums, listening to players. Most of the bugs are already fixed. What sucks:- Price. $60 is good for months of RDR2 content, not for 3-4 days of AH. Get the game for $1, for new subscribers to Gamepass. The torrent version is an unbalanced dev build, ignore it.- Linear story,  would really like to see Witcher quality-like sidequests. The side-stories are mostly reading/listening.Lots of lore is under explained. I hope it will be compensated with DLCs, as I'll be definitely waiting for them, e.g. Baba Zina is great yet lacking of her deeper story.- Feels like the game was developed by kids with their own interpretation of USSR. It's not bad, just funny. Take religious icons hanging in every house, in Soviet 50s in the houses of young scientists? Most of the things, vids and music belonging to later USSR, with the some ""creative"" explanation on why it's like that in 50s.- Most items can't be broken or interacted with.- If you miss lore in some areas, you won't be able to return there later.",Negative
4444,atomic-heart,5-Mar-23,6,"Looks good- feels bad. The PC controls are floaty and the movement is clunky, no doubt due to being a console port. It's a beautiful game, with excellent setting and immersion, but the mechanical controls, terrible narrative, and obnoxious story telling make it feel like a chore, rather than an enjoyable experience. It's pretty, and it's on Game Pass, so not a huge loss there. But, I'd probably be upset if I paid full price for it. Bioshock Infinite did it better a long time ago.",Average
4445,atomic-heart,5-Mar-23,8,"Игра мне очень понравилось особенно сюжет и атмосфера СССР. Если не читать записки или слушать аудиозаписи то сложно прочувствовать эту атмосферу поэтому советую читать и прослушать хотя бы некоторые записи.Мне очень хотелось поставить больше но после нескольких размышлений ставлю 7/10 плюс еще один балл за то что сейчас редко встречишь игры которые были сделаны с таким энтузиазмом.Минусы игры.Все еще есть баги. Мне пришлось загружать последнее сохранение изза того что затревал в текстурах раза 10-15. Визуальные баги или так далееИгра довольно дорогая. Не сильно хочется тратить на игру в которую поиграешь от силы часов 40-50. Я например за 32 часа прошел всю игру на сложности армагедон и даже побывал во всех подземных полигонах. В открытом мире особо нечего делать кроме как открывать проходы в полигоны и убивать роботов нон стоп. За часа 2 убил столько роботов в открытой месности что полимера хватило на полную прокачку телекинеса и немного мороза (Если что я не использовал читы или эксплойты. Просто было прикольно их убивать).Проходить игру сначано желания особо нету, после dark souls и elden ring я был не против пройти игру заново но с этой игрой этого желания особо нет. Я очень надеюсь что в DLS будет контента еще хотяб на часа 3 а желатьно на 10 тогда можно поставить 9/10",Positive

The studio's dedication to creating unique and immersive gaming experiences is clearly evident in every aspect of Atomic Heart, from its stunning visuals to its intricate storyline and engaging gameplay mechanics. Atomic Heart is a game that truly delivers an immersive and engaging game experience. From the moment you start playing, the game's stunning visuals and unique atmosphere draw you in, transporting you to a world that is both familiar and completely foreign. The gameplay mechanics are top-notch, with a variety of weapons and abilities that allow for a fully customized approach to each encounter. The game's storyline is equally impressive, weaving a complex and intricate narrative that keeps you on the edge of your seat. But what really sets Atomic Heart apart is its attention to detail. Every aspect of the game, from the sound design to the character animations, is executed flawlessly, creating a truly immersive world. Overall, Atomic Heart is a game that I would highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a truly exceptional gaming experience. Mundfish has truly themselves with this game, and I have no doubt that they will continue to produce exceptional games that push the boundaries of what is possible in the gaming industry.

Also can't mention bugs with collision (getting stuck in rocks and flying cars on bridge) Scenario 7/10 - was surprised with both two endings, but I think it would be better if glove-character story was shown in the gameplay, not in laptops or notes. Also in my opinion general story itself doesn't really fit USSR setting. I think it would be better if story was like the real story of RSRI (Rocket Science Research Institute), in which S. P. Korolev's was working by the way - the struggle of scientists for attention to their projects, feuds, denunciations against each other, which theoretically can result in something like what is shown in the game, which I think would fit game setting well, and not only ""im the evil just because"" plot of one of characters.

Я думаю, что это не у меня одного такое ощущение, что родилась легенда. Пусть сюжет и скомканный в конце, но блин, это шутан, и в него реально интересно играть.

If you don't like an upgrade, or a weapon, or a weapon upgrade, you'll be refunded %100 of whatever you put into it. You can do that as many times as you want with zero punishment, allowing you to truly put yourself in your own personal lab and experiment with whatever is perfect for you.Once you start playing Atomic Heart, the prologue will hook you within seconds.

4506,atomic-heart,2-Mar-23,7,"Wow this game is gorgeous and simply looks and feels fresh. They did a great job with attention to detail into the world design. The entire thing is just one big eye-candy. Gunplay is amazing but melee can be a bit clunky. Enemies aren't as bullet-spongy as you see in many other games which is good. Except Plyushch because **** that thing. It barely flinches with your attacks. Repair drones are obnoxious and shouldn't have been implemented in the first place and causes some balance issues in the combat. Story is very outlandish and ridiculous. The USSR leapfrogged 200 years technologically within just 10 years by 1955 after the end of WWII? Yeah, no. Even for sci-fi it's just too ridiculous. But fun nonetheless and there are quite a few hilarious moments too. There are some stealth elements but very badly implemented. You can take down one or maybe two enemies but stealthing your way through any area completely is just impossible. You move like snail while crouching and there is no unlockable skill to improve that. Or any skills whatsoever to improve stealth as far as I see so far. Your player character is very unlikeable. He is a petulant, chronic complainer and a stereotypical always-angry military hard-ass tough-guy with a douchy hairdo. Rarely does he open his mouth and says something positive despite literally traversing through a world full of technological marvels. It's like he doesn't even want to be in this game and just wants to go home. He doesn't even say anything let alone anything nice when acquiring a badass new weapon or a mod. I would have vastly preferred a silent protagonist over this. Quest design can be a bit last-gen-ish. You go fetch X many stuff to do Y in order to open a door to progress into the main story. It gets repetitive, boring and grindy very quickly. But there are things to do to keep it all interesting enough. Performance wise the game is very well optimized on PC and runs smooth as butter for the most part. Quite surprising in the year 2023 for a new release. However there are quite a few minor bugs here and there and I've gotten stuck in random places and corners multiple times and have had to restart last save to get out them. Very disappointing. Last thing, I don't care for the controversy surrounding this game. I'm 100% against Russian invasion of Ukraine and fully support nothing short of the total annihilation of Russian presence over there. But this game isn't Russian glorification or Soviet propaganda as many loud-mouths are claiming. If anything, it portrays Soviet-era propaganda. How the **** would you portray propaganda in a story other than just, portraying it? The story actually criticizes both Communism and Capitalism. Your player character saying ""glory to the Soviet Union"" isn't propaganda that should call for a ban. Being a Russian game dev or a story-teller isn't a crime. It's even refreshing to see a non-Western newbie game dev coming out with such a banger on their first try. I'm playing it on Xbox GamePass but wouldn't have bought it full price and would rather have waited for a sale, because it's not worth a AAA price.",Average

4508,atomic-heart,2-Mar-23,9,"ENG/RUS Great game, I haven't had this much fun playing a game in a long time. The game brought about very pleasant emotions upon release because I associated it heavily with Cyberpunk, with all its development problems, delays, and difficult launch. But it turned out to be an amazing game.Setting: This is the most important part of the game. It earns a big like from me because the setting is incredibly interesting, new, and the developers have done an amazing job of conveying its atmosphere. I would like to see more interesting games set in a retro-futuristic setting with Soviet or Sovietpunk decorations.Gameplay: Very enjoyable, intuitive, and lively. I want to try out different weapons and abilities. There are enough combinations to build different character builds. Each player can experience their own gameplay style. There were some boring, or rather, tedious moments, but these are normal for AAA games. After all, the game is huge and making it perfect is very difficult.Graphics: The game looks stunning on both PC and consoles. The textures are in high resolution, and you can even read the smallest newspapers, which adds liveliness to the game world.World: The story locations are very interesting, and different secrets (usually loot) are scattered everywhere. Each location is worth exploring, but to be honest, after 6 hours, it starts to get a little tedious. The open world is uninteresting and unnecessary for the game, so it's definitely a minus point. Отличная игра, давно не получал такого удовольствия от игры. Игра вызвала очень приятные эмоции на релизе т.к очень ассоциировал ее с Киберпанком, куча проблем с разработкой, переносы, тяжелый запуск И так далее. Но оказалось, что игра великолепнаяСеттинг: Это важнейшая часть игры. Только за это игра получает от меня жирный лайк т.к сеттинг невероятно интересный, новый и у разработчиков получилось невероятно круто передать его атмосферу. Хотелось бы видеть больше интересных игр в сеттинге ретро-футуризма с декорациями СССР или проще СоветПанком.Геймплей: Очень приятный, интуитивный, бодрый. Хочется пробывать разные оружия и способности. Достаточное количество комбинаций для построения билдов. Каждый игрок сможет  испытать собственный игровой опыт. Были и скучные, я бы сказал душные моменты, но они абсолютно нормальны для AAA игр. Все таки игра большая и сделать ее идеальной очень сложно.Графика: Игра выглядит потрясающе как и на ПК, так и на консолях. Текстуры в отличном разрешение, можно читать даже самые мелкие газеты, что дает живости игровому мируМир: Сюжетные локации очень интересные, по всюду раскиданы разные секреты (чаше всего лут), каждую локацию хочется осматривать, но, признаюсь честно, после 6 часов начинаем немного надоедать. Открытый мир неинтересный и не нужен игре за это минус бал однозначно",Positive

4533,atomic-heart,28-Feb-23,10,"Atomic Heart has the potential to be a captivating game, with its intriguing setting of a retro-futuristic Soviet Union and impressive graphics and sound design that immerse the player in this world. The game's combat system has also been praised as excellent, providing players with an enjoyable and challenging experience. However, the game's narrative falls short of its potential, with a lack of depth in the characters and storytelling that make it difficult for players to fully engage with the plot. Despite this, the game's strong gameplay mechanics help balance out the weaker aspects of the narrative. No entanto, it's important to note that in some aspects, Atomic Heart can be considered superior to Bioshock. The gameplay, graphics, and enemies, for example, are strong points of the game. Although there is a lack of variety in the types of enemies, the destructive robots with torn-off parts and the organic enemies with detailed gore provide an interesting combat experience. Additionally, the enemy moveset is impressive in its variety, making the bosses of the game worthy of FromSoftware games. In summary, Atomic Heart has its strengths and weaknesses, but overall, it is an interesting game that deserves to be explored by players seeking a challenging combat experience and a unique setting. With its impressive graphics and variety of enemies, it is possible that Atomic Heart will carve out a prominent place among games in its genre. Some poor ratings for Atomic Heart can be attributed to a boycott movement, supposedly motivated by the Russian government's involvement with the game's developer company. Furthermore, many Bioshock fans are unhappy with the game because of its lack of ""wokeness"" and considering the plot twist to be inferior to that of the Bioshock franchise. However, these fans are ignoring Atomic Heart's superior gameplay.",Positive

Миша, всё хуйня, давай по новой. Они слишком похожи на обычных мобов. У них нет слабых точек, я не могу отстрелить роботу конечности или повредить хоть как-то его механизм работы. Это тупо долбёжка, пока у босса хп не кончится. Да, круто, босс имеет уникальные атаки. Но, мои ж вы зайки, этого не достаточно. Босс-файт предполагает разработку какой-либо уникальной тактики. В механике первого босса было предусмотрено разбивание статуй на арене, зачёт чего можно было пройти Ежиху без единого выстрела и получить ачивку. Круто, но на этом креатива у разрабов закончился, потрму что остальные боссы одолевались банальным нанесением урона просто по корпусу робота. Опять же, беру в пример Хорайзн - там можно было роботу выстрелить в колено, око, пасть, нанести критический урон и как-то сломать робота. Это интереснее, чем 5 минут играть в стимулятор уворотов, непрерывно стреляя из калашаПовествованиеИгра очень долго раскачивалась после быстрой завязки. Во время этой самой раскачки, информацию нам подавали через диалог главного героя с перчаткой. Мне было и так трудно вникнуть в новую неизученную вселенную и понять все её термины и законы, так меня ещё буквально во время стрельбы нагружают кучей информацией про предприятие и ебанутые планы местных властей и учёных. Они прям слишком много информации передавали посредством разговора гг с перчаткой. Часть этой инфы можно было бы показать в кат сценах, задействовать других персонажей, чтобы игрок буквально не сошёл с ума. Большую часть времени мы проводим на едине с перчаткой и монстрами. Вообще, остальные не игровые, но важные для сюжета персонажи, почти не используются в игре. Только лишь в завязке и развязке.

4551,atomic-heart,28-Feb-23,9,"Having completed Atomic Heart, I can say with confidence that this is the game that has been missing for so long. From beautiful visual style to excellent music and immersion in the game world. The gameplay is addictive, but it has drawbacks in the form that not all abilities make sense and not all items of equipment are useful in combat, besides this can be such a feature of the game, but I think that such a slow movement is rather a minus than a plus it would be better if the gameplay was faster and more energetic. I think there should be no questions about graphics and optimization on a PC, because everything is done well. There are such claims to the open world, such as the fact that Moskvich in the game is apparently the same in quality as in real life and explodes from three collisions, also the fact that there are no particular points of interest in the game, except for polygons, so after completing the story, continue there is no point in playing, but as I remember, the developers did not say that this is a new Witcher, Red Dead Redemtion or a new part of the Elder Scrolls where you can live. The combat is good, but as already mentioned it is a little slow and needs more variety. Despite the fact that the reviews do not pay due attention to the plot, I am ready to say that it pleasantly surprised me, especially the ending, which gives a good plot to continue, I also did not predict all the plot moves in advance and concluding the topic, we can say that the plot is good concentrated, well remembered and not squandered for 100 hours or more. There are not so many characters influencing the plot, but everyone has a character and is more or less interesting, I don’t agree with the claim that the main character and glove talk a lot because it better reveals the world and characters, I can’t help but agree that the main character is a bit of a gopnik , however, this is explained by the plot and makes it more expressive, and of course, one should not forget about the Ballerina Twins (because of which even Tibetan monks would refuse the Abstinence procedure), Eleanor (vulgar refrigerator) and Baba Zina, who became not only symbols of the game, but also memes. In conclusion, I want to say that the game turned out to be interesting and enticing, because you do not have time to get tired of it and it captures you with its atmosphere, design and musical accompaniment, it is also worth mentioning that boycotting or vice versa praising the game because of its political opinion, as well as criticism of the game, even without really knowing anything about it, is stupidity and complete disrespect not only for the authors, but also for art in general",Positive

4564,atomic-heart,28-Feb-23,9,"This game represents another (non-common) loock on retro-futurism i mean commonly when you think about this art style you can remember such games as Bioshock or Fallout and so on but all these games represent American retro-futurism here we got Soviet Union aesthetics. it permeates every aspect of the game. Recognizable soundtracks that can vary as remixes or be original as it were. Recognizable elements of furniture from the Soviet Union that are probably still in your basement/garage or even in your room (I’m talking about CIS). And from this point of view, it is kinda impressive how this old technology represented and developed in something new in case of retro-futurism. But if we look at the graphical part of the game as it is you can notice that the open world has much less detail and looks kinda empty compared to closed spaces such as different factories, hospitals or theatres. So in conclusion audio/visual part of the game is very strong, especially from point of view of CIS players. The gameplay part is an interesting mix of first-person shooter and puzzle game, and to my taste game is kinda overloaded with puzzles it no so complicated but it is met too often. Arsenal in this game is no so big but offset by a large number of upgrades. The last thing is a plot of the game which permeates by a lot of jokes (some of them are kinda vulgar some of them can be understood only by CIS players) with some interest twists. Another great fact is that game can offer not only a happy end (i hate how often nowadays a game has only this option) but also a bad ending. As result we got game that like layered cake some of the layer you will enjoy so much some of them you will glad to miss but overal its original strong game which brings a breath of fresh air into the established niche of retrofuturism. P.S. I forgot to say that this game doesn't have any technical issues compared to the latest game releases, is it that hard to optimize games?",Positive

Снял 2 балла из-за того, что разработчики забыли позвать звукорежисера, с этим тут плохо, и второй балл за жеванную и рванную подачу сюжета. Больше докопаться не до чего. Игра ни разу не душная, 27 часов пылесосил полигоны и ни разу не возникло мысли, что надоело играть. Головоломки в меру сложные, но всё же достаточно простые, 2-3 попытки и ты уже в следующей комнате полигона, большинство же проходится по наитию с 1го раза. Игра вряд ли станет культовой в мире( в СНГона стала таковой ещё до выхода) , как сталкер( не вижу тут особой реиграбельности и причин, почему тут можно сидеть по 100+ часов), но в историю она себя точно вписала, из-за шумихи вокруг неё.

Ukrainians. By the way, the game actually does not promote anything, as someone claims (I would even say, it will discredit many aspects of the Soviet Union to some extent).

4604,atomic-heart,27-Feb-23,4,"Nothing ground breaking, nothing that doesn't seem like a derivative of truly classic entiries of the tech-utopia turned dystopia genre.It feels like a superficial and undercooked amalgam of truly legendary games like Bioshock, Deus Ex, Dishonored and Dying Light to name a few. I guess they say why be original when you can copy. Even many of the enemies seem taken from other forms of popular culture distilled into less exciting versions and installed in the world.A strong recommendation to Mundfish: invest a little more in your dialogue and narrative design, as all your hard work creating beautiful environments is often overshadowed by the awkward verbal cliches of the protagonist. These works great in Far Cry Blood Dragon and Bulletstorm but less so in a game that seemingly takes it self so seriously. An thesaurus would serve you well.As Mundfish is a new studio I'll wait and see their next steps which hopefully will involve a silent protagonist.",Negative

Cyberpunk was beautiful, but it became smooth after half a year) Aesthetics, combat, gameplay in general - I'm very surprised, I thought we'd be a nice atmospheric parachka, but here they made the game a direct game, like in 2007) It plays great on the highest difficulty, I recommend it. Just a fresh breath of air after any casualness of the corridor ... Here, too, a corridor, but there is no feeling of claustrophobia. How did they manage to optimize the game in such a way that on my 2060 super it runs on atomic settings with fps 60+ - some kind of witchcraft ...

4613,atomic-heart,27-Feb-23,1,"This game is terrible and I don't understand how so many people are giving it positive reviews. The positive reviews I see are something to the effect of ""Wow Bioshock Infinite meets Wolfenstein!"" or ""SovietShock!"" and ignore anything about the actual game it self.Cons: - The first thing I noticed during the opening cutscenes was that when I panned to either side as far as I could go it would push my camera back to the center an inch, or so, if I wasn't actively pushing it that direction. Why? Let me look at my surroundings.- The voice acting is trash. It has no emotion and doesn't match what's going on in the actual scene or moment in the game. It has some Tommy Wiseau in The Room level editing where voice lines are almost on top of each other before the other character has really even finished speaking. Along with the bad voice acting/editing is the bad sound design. There were often times where there was sound just straight up missing or mismatched. The part where Granny fires the rocket launcher the sound was basically just not there.. Felt like an alpha build of the game which is sad considering this part took place in under the first hour of the game. I thought maybe the voice acting would take a back seat to the other features of the game but no. The main character and his sentient glove talk nonstop. The dialogue is real- It's buggy. One of the very first enemies comes through a door which I attacked, and then he got stuck behind the door. I could attack and kill him, but I couldn't loot him. The door never opened again. Some enemies flash on screen before actually showing up and are attackable.- The looting. The looting is the most tedious thing about this game. It's marketed as an easy ""continue to hold F and and you vacuum everything up"" when in reality you have to hold F in very specific spots, and for long enough, or it doesn't count if you've looted it entirely and you miss items. There's also entirely too many objects to loot which adds to the tediousness.- Batman detective mode. The radar mode helps slightly with making sure you loot everything but it's super inconsistent. Certain items are visible super far away and some not; some visible around corners and some not. Felt like I was constantly pulling it up, and when I didn't I would pull it up to find I missed a single metal crouton in a single pencil drawer in a room full of 50 different lootable filing cabinets.- Combat isn't great. The responsiveness of the dodge and light attack seem to work well. But the first upgrade you get is a whirlwind heavy attack. Takes a long time to complete, spins your vision, and you can be hit while finishing the long attack time. I'm sure it works ok with upgraded versions of the freeze and shield, but why bother when you can light attack, dodge without getting dizzy.- Platforming. Feels like the most tacked on aspect of the game. The game doesn't explain at all how to move while climbing walls and pipes. I just moved my mouse and character around until eventually my character awkwardly put out his arm and then I knew ""oh ok now its time for me to jump"". A lot of the time you jump and miss. Instead of falling all the way down you get caught on an weird part of the geometry like a crack in the cement wall that clearly isn't meant to be stood upon.- Horny fridge? Why? Just why? I guess it fits with the terrible writing.Pros: Runs well, looks nice, and the environments are well done. That's it. That's literally all of it.Normally don't write reviews but this is genuinely one of the worst games I've played to date. Felt worth saying something against all of the ""positive"" reviews that don't actually say anything about the game. All of this in under two hours of game play. Refunded it.",Negative

Не припомню, чтобы в какой-либо другой игре была так приятно реализована механика простого сбора снаряжения. Разнообразие видов оружия не уступает разнообразию видов врагов. Сюжет заслуживает отдельного внимая, он не супер неповторим, но благодаря харизматичным и запоминающимся персонажам кажется довольно интересным и неповторимым. В персонажей, на мой взгляд, разработчики смогли как никогда. Радует наличие гибкой системы прокачки. Лично для меня эта игра станет скорее всего игрой года в том случае, если не впечатлит Resident evil 4 Remake. Но пока у это игры конкурентов немного и скорее всего не будет ещё долго.",Positive

After all, even people born after the collapse of the USSR remember some moments from their childhood.I have read a lot of comments and am amazed at the ignorance.

If you were looking for a BioShock-like game discussing communism in its story, this isn't it. There is no nuance to its story and the dialogue falls over itself (and overtop of other dialogue with its poor sound design). I feel its controversy helped blind people from the faults of this game. Combat is lack luster, the looting system is okay, and the characters are just bland. Its strongest aspects are its art design and its music. Even for music though it doesn't fit the tone that this game wants to present, or at least tries to present. While Mick's ost is great as always, I think the game is strongest when it relies on classical pieces to elevate the tone of the game. Overall the game has been done and is very uninspiring.",Negative

The real downfall is the gameplay that just makes this a grind.  A locker that has a shelf, but you need to aim at the top and bottom to get both (one of the many mechanics taken from Techland's Dying Light 1 which they abandoned for 2).  Or areas the devs did not want you to go being instant death without any decent reason or markings.

4663,atomic-heart,26-Feb-23,10,"Ну что ж, очень редко когда жду игры, но тут было исключением. Наиграл 22 часа, аккуратно, неспешно и ещё не прошел. Сразу стоит отметить атмосферу с первых минут игры, да, это прям заставляет немного кайфануть с происходящего. Дальше геймплей, по сути это биошок на сссрский лад. Физика ударов проработана отлично, следы от ударов остаются на броне роботов как нужно. Геймплей не наскучил: изначально в комплексе, затем более менее открытый мир с возможностью опять погружаться в подземные комплексы ради дополнительного лута и прокачки своего оружия. И все эти перемещения происходят снова под отличное музыкальное сопровождение и на машине времён советского союза. Играл на максимальной сложности, умер пару раз, основные проблемы возникали именно с боссами(запоминать нужно их атаки). Итого по геймплею: рубится весело(за все время не надоело, разве что уже перед самым концом когда хотелось получить все модификации для оружия), играется хорошо, без фризов, графика отличная если выкрутить четкость на ""2"" в настройках и играть в 2 или 4к. Во время игры как таковых крупных багов мешающих геймплею или прохождению не обнаружено, однако мелкие баги(текстуры мобов взлетают, исчезают или ещё как-то печально взаимодействуют). Считаю что мои ожидания оправдались и полностью подтверждены, даже лучше (как обычно думал что будет проблема с оптимизацией, но разработчики просто убрали на релизе ртх и все отлично). Сильно ли изменится картинка с ртх? Думаю нет, ибо отражения, во всяком случае в первой локации проработаны хорошо, поначалу даже подумал что ртх есть... Но увы, пока его нет как и изменения поля зрения. Как по мне это несущественные недочёты и я ставлю крепкую 10-ку. Ах да, некоторые индивиды ставят игре низкую оценку потому что это СССР, Россия, пропаганда.

All other characters are also equally insufferable. Lastly gameplay - it's unbalanced and painfully boring with how spongy it is, with iffy hitboxes, terrible melee and some obnoxious mechanics as fixer robots. Atomic Heart is a game that promises a lot but delivers very little. Massive disappointment, may be even the biggest in 2023 as I had some decent hopes for this one with how rare story FPS games have become. If not FOV and mouse acceleration - I'd probably give it 6, but with these two problems it's just spit in the face to PC gamers and 4/10 is about as much as it deserves.",Negative

Сюжет банальный, в СССР нашли новое вещество ""Полимер"", с его помощью построили роботов. Ну и как неожиданно случился сбой и роботы начали всех убивать.

Guns are fun to use, and game ends before things start to feel repetetive. You get different guns that calls for different play styles, and on top of that, each gun has dedicated upgrades that changes or adds functionality which makes it even more fun. Enemy interactions are fun, they usually take damage/get damaged realistically.. Story and setting were more than good enough to captivate me through the end. Setting is actually rather spectacular, and story has multiple plot twists that hit you back to back. I was interested all the time. World is crafted with a lot of detail and lore and you can read all about it in in-game terminals. Open world is there, but it is not tedious as most open world games are. It is a condensed world that just acts as a tool to progress the story. You enter ""hubs"" called training grounds for weapon upgrades and additional loot, and these locations boast different challenges, platforming puzzles and so on. You do not need to do all of them; game specifically tells you what upgrades you will find in specific training grounds, which is a welcome feature. This way you can focus on the upgrades for the weapons you desire and ignore others. However game was so captivating that I ended up completing most of the training grounds, it simply was fun. BadsWell story is a bit cliche, and dialogue can get cringey at times (not all times! sometimes it gets very philosophical and makes you stop and think about stuff).Sometimes there are too much dialogue to a point it overlaps with stuff.Quest design is a bit archaic, mostly they're fetch/go grab type of quests.

The plot is extremely convoluted and unclear, and the gameplay feels monotonous and boring, making the game difficult to play for a long time. Additionally, the game contains many unclear elements and interactions with characters, which does not add to its interest and variability. Overall, I cannot recommend Atomic Heart as a game worth your time and attention.

Unfortunately, most Western colleagues will consider this propaganda of the USSR (or Putin's Russia), while they themselves are grown up (like some Russians) on anti-Soviet, anti-communist and anti-Russian propaganda. And they will not allow themselves to believe in happiness of USSR citizens in their own world with their aspirations and ideals.

On top of that, the game is incredibly slow paced, littered with bugs, and is filled with stupid unnecessary puzzle elements. I'm starting to wonder if the imagination of game developers have stagnated, because this is yet another title with sci-fi elements where you have to fight monsters, robots, and combat weird ass creatures. Also, some missions in game are just insane. For example when you need to ride on a train and need a ticket. You get a ticket, but it's expired, so you need a new one. Way to spend my game time developers. >.< All in all, if your looking for a nice looking Sci-Fi FPS, then sure... give it a try. But this is seriously one of the most annoying games I have ever played. You waste A TON of time doing **** and useless things while trying to navigate all the bugs and issues in the game. Atomic Heart is not a good game.",Negative

4701,atomic-heart,26-Feb-23,8,"Atomic Heart offers many positive aspects that make it an enjoyable experience. Firstly, the campaign is well-constructed and gives players a satisfying feeling of accomplishment. The story is engaging and easy to follow until the end of the game when the hand AI becomes the villain. The guns in the game feel great to use, and resources are easy to obtain, which makes for a smooth gameplay experience. The gameplay itself is fun and exciting, with interesting boss fights, despite some glitches that affected the game's performance. The character development is also fantastic, with the protagonist P3 being a standout character due to his cocky yet humorous personality. Additionally, the open-world setting and the narrative placement are intriguing, and the game manages to blend elements from other popular games like Wolfenstein and BioShock into something unique. Finally, the character Granny stands out for her heart and her role in helping the protagonist. However, the game also has several negative aspects that detract from the overall experience. The gameplay can become repetitive, and boss fights can take an excessive amount of time, sometimes over an hour at the beginning of the game . The game also suffers from bugs that can affect the gameplay and cause crashes. The robot chainsaws are also not enjoyable to kill and they are annoying  AF. While the open-world aspect of the game looks cool, it feels more linear and Hands-On. The game can also overload players with too many enemies, leading to performance issues and even crashes on my computer and on xbox. Finally, the sexy robot voice box   crafting new items and you have to wait until it's done making the created item  can become annoying and disrupt the flow of the game. In summary, Atomic Heart offers an enjoyable campaign with engaging characters and an interesting narrative placement. The gameplay is fun and exciting, with great gun and melee weapons mechanics and accessible resources. However, the game suffers from repetitive gameplay, lengthy boss fights, bugs, and other issues that can detract from the experience. Despite these drawbacks, the game remains an engaging and entertaining experience overall.",Positive
4702,atomic-heart,26-Feb-23,9,"That's an actual review. I've finished the game and let myself cooldown for a day before trying to write down some of my thought just to find my FB account being blocked and I can't login. Played on PC, medium skill gamer, started on medium difficulty then switched to hard for better experience.For anyone out there reading this - ignore other reviews that contain ""bad optimization"" (on PC; that might be a thing on consoles, I have no idea) and ""soviet propaganda"", since the game runs great and once you play the game and finish it you'll see what the story is really about. Well optimized beautiful game with good gameplay. Good story, strong role of main character, yet awkward voice acting (Filatova is bad in Russian) from time to time and lots of references and easter eggs for ethnical post-soviet players that makes poking around in notes, messages and audios much more interesting. Ambient music is good, combat music is great yet some gameplay stutters at large combat areas makes it stop, that's frustrating.Sidenote. Beating around the bush about sex is just great way to go to make fun of ideological facade of society. You may find it misplaced, I find it hilarious.Great game. 9/10. My score is based on fact that I'm ethnical Russian, your experience may vary.PS: I have no idea why does so many reviews compares it to BioShock, since there's nothing common between these two games except somewhat retro-futuristic setting and combat ""powers"". Отличная оптимизация, хороший геймплей и отлично срежисированная история. Сюжет хороший, но возможно не хватает развития в первой половине игры. Окружение и мир созданы с большим вниманием к деталям. Главный герой отыгрывает свою роль отлично. Российская озвучка великолепная, кроме Филатовой. Игра захватывает внимание. 9/10.",Positive
4703,atomic-heart,26-Feb-23,9,"Atomic heart is a good game. It has a great style, the developers have spent a lot of time on details. For example, when pumping weapons, the reloading animations change and the weapon changes its appearance. There are many elaborate locations, even non-mandatory dungeons are made by hand. Music deserves a special mention. It's just perfect and I'm ready to give the game +5 points for it right away. But there are also disadvantages. There are bugs in the game, such as: it is not possible to collect a resource from the corpses of bosses, enemies get stuck in textures, it is impossible to loot boxes  that lie horizontally. Also weak optimization on the xbox series s. the plot is normal, but not as good as it could be.

The main character reminds me of the main character from the Wolfenstein series and ""crispy critters"" is a completely valid thing for a character to say in an alternate 1950s world. I haven't finished it yet so I don't know if it's a good value or the quality falls off toward the end but so far I like it. It plays a lot like BIoshock but that doesn't mean it's a ripoff. It's truly on whoever owns the Bioshock trademarks that they haven't released a sequel recently or come up with this setting themselves. The game just needs a FOV slider.",Positive

4732,atomic-heart,25-Feb-23,8,"Atomic Heart is highly anticipated role-play game by Mundfish. Set is an alternate soviet union, the game follows the story of a KGB agent sent to investigate a mysterious situation where strange things are happening. Graphics. 9/10One of the standout features of Atomic Heart is its stunning visuals. The game's graphics are truly breathtaking, with incredibly detailed environments and character designs that really bring the world to life. -1 score because of lack of RTX on release version. Art and music. 10/10The artists tried to convey the atmosphere of the USSR and they succeeded. Cars, buildings, posters - all this takes the player to the era of the 50s. The musical component also does its job. Nothing more to add than to rate 10! Gameplay. 9/10The mechanics of Atomic Heart is what caught my attention in trailers and pre-release reviews. Combat system at the highest level, all damage is calculated correctly and without glitches, as it was in dark souls and elden ring. Customizing and upgrading weapons is what you will have to do throughout your journey through the 3826 complex. Fortunately, it's not even boring! Puzzles in the levels of the game and on the polygons really often make the gray matter move. I’ll be lying if I say that I didn’t watch the walkthrough on YouTube 2-3 times... Story. 8/10I will not go into details, and especially in spoilers, but I will say that the story did not really interest me at first. I would generally divide the game into 2 parts, in terms of the main story, where the first part is quite extended and trivial. Action begins in the middle of the game, and the plot, like the main characters, begins to reveal theirselfs. You are really imbued with the feelings and curious nature of P3, although he is slow-witted in many places, the smart glove HRAZ will always explain through the hero, to us players, what is happening here. Baba Zina as a separate masterpiece of art.  Also, the final throws a bait for the sequel. NPCs and open-world. 7/10The characters are well written, but at the same time quite readable. The variety of robots is great, but at the end of the game even this becomes boring. The bosses are simple, I spent a maximum of 3 attempts on each (dark souls tempers in this regard). But the main disadvantage of this game, in my opinion, is the presence of an open world. This is exactly the case when the open world spoils the overall picture. It is bad and simply unnecessary. Endless hordes of robots and generally no activity of additional tasks and other things. I also want to note that I noticed a lot of references for games such as Portal, with its puzzles and rooms, and the Dominator gun, which vaguely reminds me of a portal gun. The story itself, or rather its development, is very reminiscent of Half Life. And in the moments where the cob sits on the head of a dead soldier and starts running at you like a zombie, it threw me back to my childhood. In general, the game is played with pleasure in 2-3 days, and I can definitely recommend this game for attention.",Positive

4739,atomic-heart,25-Feb-23,3,"Someone once called Atomic Heart the ""Bolshevik Bioshock."" This is a succinct, accurate view from my experience. The world is a bit hollow, as so much of what you see is just decorations. You can't pop the balloons with your axe. The hanging dead bodies look like statutes and they're impervious to your attacks as well. You can knock over a few things, but not most. It's a shame as the world looks nice, however you can't interact with it much. Several cliches abound, starting with the giant happy world of tomorrow crashing and going off the rails. Speaking of crashing, how many games have a flying crash in the introduction now? Then you find your token melee weapon right away, and slowly find other ballistic weapons as you go. Some doors are blocked with devices that remind me of Half-Life or Dishonored. You'll find fires that burn endlessly, transportation systems on the fritz, happy computer voices telling you to calmly evacuate, and all the other tropes of the genre. You're now ready to follow the advice of your onboard AI Cortana, I mean Charles, as he directs you around the world by the hand (literally, as he's a glove). Several predetermined scenes appear, and you will die a few times if you advance to far and get caught by a digging snake machine or other programmed event. When you do perish, the reload time is long. And for whatever reason, in the year 2023 you cannot save anywhere but are instead limited to specific save rooms. The game may save periodically on its own, but you can't control it.  This makes reliving the lame conversations and forced cutscenes particularly annoying. Eventually you meet a crass Coke machine looking upgrade box which lets you use your plasmids, I mean neuromod, no wait, it's... neuromodule? So now you have the token electrical power, Shok (cause reasons). You're forced to buy this one so you can shock your way through some doors, just like in BioShock. Other doors will be various lock picking games, because it's a requirement to have lockpicking. Using the potty mouth refrigerator you'll be able to craft upgrades of course, as is the style at the time. You need recipes as the devs don't want you to have too much fun by making the weapons you want before they're ready for you to have access to them. So for now, you've got a fire axe, shotgun, Shok, and maybe one other typical ability, but that's it. You then begin to get through the enemies which detect you at great distances and move much faster than you can. If you luck out you can get the Obi Wan approved high ground to chop away as they stand there and take it. You'll slow your walk as you scan the scene with your Detective Vision or whatever the ""limited colors see through walls where power ups light up"" view. Most of the stuff you loot is just parts for grafting or med kits, taking a good bit of fun out of it. However for me, my story ends here as I get soft locked where I'm told I need to buy a power up but I already did. I still get the dialogue option, but cannot activate it, so I die on the laser grid separating me from my next objective. I'll leave the game installed  for a bit, but I'm not drawn to it and that's the biggest sign to me. For my money and time, it's not worth it. Your kilometers may vary, and more power to you if so, but for me Atomic Heart is a ""нет"" at present. I'll wait a bit and see if they fix this, but as it stands this is a boring disappointment.",Negative

4748,atomic-heart,25-Feb-23,10,"ГРА БОМБА нагадує СЕРІЮ БІОШОК але зі своєю родзинкою. До мінусів гри можна віднести лише її тривалу тривалість і дуже плоских персонажів. Не вистачило експресії Баби Зіни та Нечаєва. Також досить не просто читати субтитри. Було цікаво грати, але субтитри дрібні.Сподіваюсь будуть доповнення. І автори вирішать проблему з головоломками та замками. У тому ж Біошок були начебто обхідні шляхи. Тут треба потрапляти у такт і це не завжди виходить. Громадяни грайте в гру про альтернативний СРСР вдумливо і ви побачите відмінну антиутопію, що досить сміливо. Якщо порівнювати із серією Метро то динамічних сцен у грі Атомік Херт багато. Якщо порівнювати із серією Сталкер то багів критичних на релізі немає. Враховуючи, що це перша гра студії. А Козаки 3 вийшли дуже посередніми. Сталкер 2 чекаю, але боюся через проблеми і кранчі гра вийде дуже мізерною і бідною в плані опрацювання світу. Можу помилятися. Ну а поки що можу побажати розробникам КІПОРСЬКИМ удачі Ваш Московський продукт вийшов). А я повертаюся до Гоґвортсу))).",Positive

Special thanks to the developers for not being afraid to add sexy female characters. This is very nice even though they are robots. I would also like to thank the developers for their courage and resilience. It's nice to see that the attempts of Ukrainian bloggers to call for players to bycott this beautiful game failed miserably and the game has a deserved success. For myself, I will allocate one minus - it's not the best optimization of the game. But I think that soon it will fix patches.",Positive

Импакт от стрельбы и убийств противников отлично замечается, это также радует. Не радует только болтливый главный герой и его ИИ-перчатка, которые не замолкают ни на секунду.

Being a huge Bioshock fan, this game instantly got my attention, and for a few months i've been eagerly waiting for its release, preordering and everything, only to be met with respawning, bullet sponge enemies, incredibly poor dialogue, boring puzzles that the game makes fun of itself (that doesn't make it endearing, you just acknowledge your own poor level design) and horndog npcs. The gameplay was lackluster and the only few things I found entertaining was the beautiful environments, animations, and enemy design. Game peaked at the Hedgie boss imo, that was actually really fun and was a huge step in the right direction. I never found the mouse acceleration to be a huge issue, actually didnt even notice it was on until I read other negative reviews. Kinda worth it if you pick it up on sale 80% off, otherwise a waste of my hard earned 60$",Negative
4768,atomic-heart,25-Feb-23,10,That's great! I've never seen anything like it anywhere! I think that's exactly what the Soviet people dreamed of! It's a pity that everything went wrong in the game... And in life.,Positive

I didn't got a lot of weapons blueprints even that I looted every chest i found. The game should award you with a new weapon on your story progression, but no!, Its given a blueprint at random, so you need to craft yourself. There was a bug for me that keep showing the wrong quest tracker, Always switch from the quest you are from an another previous quest. There is a lot of enemies that you cannot fight and must run. And sometimes it gives 10 enemies at once that you must kill all to progress. The game have good performance, I got 100-150 FPS on my RTX 3060 TI, But there is no Ray Tracing. Maybe it's a good thing, I would disable it anyways. At a lot of times the enemies come at you and get you stuck on the wall, and keep attacking you while you are stuck on a wall. You cannot craft any ammo you want, You must have a damn blueprint for it, And that is as well as randomly got on chests.",Average

Les parts sensuals són bastant gracioses d'escoltar, i a vegades una mica excessives, però no passa res, no canvia la diversió que produeix.

4777,atomic-heart,25-Feb-23,9,"In general, initially the game seemed to be like BioShock, according to the trailers, I was preparing for this. But, in the end, the game is a very good replacement for Half-Life. I was not disappointed that instead of BioShock I play Russian Half-Life. Probably, this is the first part, and in the second ability they will do much better, but so far I do not use them. More precisely, not as often as I did in Prey, BioShock and Dishonored. But, nevertheless, the game is very interesting and very cool. The game world is also very interesting. I like the micromanagement of guns, a backpack, this has not happened in my memory for a long time. I like all sorts of gadgets for guns, with additional damage to opponents. This moment, in contrast to the abilities, was done well. I love the cutscenes, they are beautiful. The plot is also very interesting, but for the most part it is the gameplay and audio diaries that give you. I missed that **** with Bioshock and Doom 3, I guess, where you could listen to the diary, get involved in the story and still play the game. But graphics are 50/50. This is Unreal Engine 4, and the shoals of graphics, because of which I want to say that these are Unreal Engine graphics are visible here to the naked eye. All the same, while different Home Engines, in terms of graphics, outperform Unreal. I hope the situation will change with the arrival of Unreal Engine 5 in games. I'm serious, you'll burn out badly if you stick to the local graphics in the game. If you want a grafonic game, on Unreal Engine, then you are in The Callisto Protocol. Music, not bad licensed, as well as mixed and Mick Gordon's music. Especially in computers and battles. In general, thanks to Mundfish for letting me return to 1998 and Half-Life, I hope that the second Atomic Heart will be in two or three years, and there will be less jambs, and more BioShock gameplay. Well, or Half-Life gameplay. 9 out of 10",Positive

4792,atomic-heart,25-Feb-23,10,"Игра не лишена своих шерховатостей и недостатков в геймплее, наполненности мира и постановке, но прошу заметить, что это дебютный проект - а для дебюта игра выше всяких похвал. Это действительно глоток свежего воздуха в большом геймдеве, как в контексте повествования так и в контексте механик боя, глубины проработки мира. Про стилистику, арт-дизайн и сам мир говорить можно бесконечно, но это без дураков  - просто поражающий вниманием к деталям взрыв креатива. Нереально красиво и здорово! Очень свежая подача идеи ретрофутуризма, который никогда ранее не представлялся в таком контексте и форме. Игра впервые за долго подарила ощущение новизны, желание исследования даже у человека, который испытывает период охлаждения интереса к геймингу. Нет пресных идей, нет пресного штампованного окружения, обежжиреных характеров и диалогов, которые заполонили современную индустрию! Я ленивый пользователь, но именно сейчас игра породила желание зарегистрироваться на метакритике и написать впервые в жизни отзыв. Не слушайте никого, кто пытается искать с микроскопом минусы у игры - он всегда их найдет. Смело покупайте и пробуйте, играйте, составляйте свое мнение. Я почти уверен, что вам пронравится! Игра - явление  и надеюсь, начало нового хорошего тренда! Разработчикам искренне желаю успехов, удачи и главное твердости. Не слушайте никого, не вливайтесь в общие тренды и AAA-струю - она желтого цвета. Не прогибайтесь под активистов, обзорщиков из верхнего интернета и прочих людей, которые не имею отношения к игровой индустрии, а только паразитируют на ней. Продолжайте отстаивать свое мнение, видение, не бойтесь быть смелыми. Люди поддержат вас словом  и деньгами,  если вы продолжите в том же духе.",Positive

Боевая система отстой( оружие ощущается как пластиковое ).Графика тоже посредственная .

Nowadays, when AAA studios are messing up with all their projects, it's hard not to be surprised how newcomers in gamedev were able to make a game that: a) has gorgeous graphics that are perfectly optimizedb) has interesting gameplay that mixes action and puzzles, never letting you get boredc) has an interesting story that keeps you intrigued until the very end and demonstrating cool and fascinating cutscenesd) has a great soundtrack, both referring to the songs of the 80s, and just creating an atmospheree) has memorable characters with good humor at the Portal 2 level, which I just adore Summing up, I can say that even if there really are some issues and bugs in the game, when you go through it, you remain more than satisfied with this project, and this is probably the best thing I've ever played, for which I am incredibly grateful to Mundfish. This is a huge breakthrough for the Russian gamedev, and I will be waiting for new projects from this studio, one of which should definitely be Atomic Heart 2, judging from the open final.",Positive

4806,atomic-heart,25-Feb-23,7,"Игра хороша, но далеко не идеальна.Вообще, я очень долго ждал Atomic Heart, и после полного прохождения я получил спорные воспоминания. Слабые концовки. Да, концовка, связанная с предательством Сеченова была довольно сильна, я испытал много эмоций, но вторая концовка оказалась очень скудной и неинтересной. Я ожидал большего. 5/10Оптимизация и баги. Она не идеальна, на протяжении игры встречались лаги (в особенности в лифтах или каких-либо других закрытых помещениях) но в общем случае графика хорошая по сравнению с оптимизацией. Вылеты. Мое любимое. Игра вылетала (не у меня одного) на версии от XBOX с Windows 10. Помогало снятие задачи «проводника» в диспетчере задач. Но такое на финальной версии игры - полный позор. (и да, я не исключаю прочих багов с миссиями, такие имеются, почитайте форумы - увидите). 5/10Сложность игры. Я играл на сложности - сложное и встретил очень много интересных моментов. Во-первых, боссы проходятся легче, чем обычная толпа мутантов или роботов. Порой, если у вас мало хила и патронов (а так у вас точно будет) поэтому такого рода противостояния будут заканчиваться смертью, а иного варианта у вас точно не будет, чем идти фармить. А что насчет фарма на улицах? Тут у вас вариантов попросту нет, так как с таким уровнем сложности вас просто задолбают ромашки, а вместе с ним и другие роботы. Покоя от них точно не будет, а значит и фарма соответственно тоже. Я веду к тому, что с таким уровнем сложности пройти игру очень тяжело, порой практически невозможно, хотя это уровень не “хардкор”, а именно «сложно». 5/10Транспорт. Это просто сырой кусок игры, который надо еще дорабатывать. У меня машина взрывалась от легкого столкновения об порог (кстати да, на машине здесь нельзя проехать порог, высотой в четверть колеса). От одного столкновения с роботом на машине вы также можете взорваться. Любое прикосновение к этому красному москвичу - смерть. Это бред. 3/10Музыка. Это очень круто. Но сама система появления музыки - немного багованная. Порой у меня играл жесткий ремикс советских песен, когда была максимально спокойная обстановка, хотя это нужно включать в момент файта. 8/10.Система боя и разнообразие оружейного арсенала. Сказать нечего - это круто. Мне все понравилось. Но разнообразие, правда, хромает. Пару автоматов и пистолетов, 1 гранатомет. 8/10Сюжет. Если не брать в расчет концовки - не затянуто и довольно интересно. Есть над чем испытать свои эмоции. 10/10Атмосфера. Передана идеально. Геймдизайнеры постарались. 10/10.Итого: 7/10.",Average

I can remember empty shelves in stores, dental procedures without any painkillers (for communist's elite only) and a lot of propaganda, from every and each corner. What you currently see from russia, war, terrorism and nuclear statements and support of all this from russians, it's a direct result of long propaganda about great USSR, restoration of USSR and all the myths, how great it was and that it would be great country if not evil western countries. This game (from russian developers on russian moneys) serves exactly this purpose - deliver myths about great USSR, ""the great country we've lost"" to make people dream about restoration of this freaking ...hole with sadness, that such great future was ruined by evil west (just see modern russian propaganda on all tv channels). So, game is good.

Also many bugs from the start.I noticed issues such as characters getting stuck in the environment, checkpoints not triggering correctly and I can't pass, crashes that forced me to restart the game.

4866,atomic-heart,24-Feb-23,8,"The cons:It's fairly buggy.  Here's some of the bugs I encountered.- A save file had me loading and then immediately falling through the floor.  Prior saves couldn't be loaded for some reason.  Thankfully restarting the game resolved it but that could have been bad.- After crashing multiple times during a boss battle I lowered my graphic settings to low (on a 1070ti) and it resolved that issue.- An NPC's character model became dislodged from his face and his neck stretched about 10 feet away.  I could still see his eye balls and gum/teeth models inside of his head.- After choosing a skill tree perk of ""gain more loot when killing frozen enemies"", I noticed that the humanoid shaped enemies would leave no loot at all when they were killed while frozen, as their corpse disintegrates into ice cubes.  This defeated the point of aquiring that perk.- During the final boss battle the enemies became stuck in place after defeating them, forcing me to restart and beat them again.- I became stuck in the map while climbing out of a pool multiple times.- I defeated a puzzle in a way they hadn't intended, which kept me from exiting the puzzle until I had completed it. Other cons: During an early dungeon you have to solve a puzzle and then immediately fight a pretty tough boss.  If you died you have to re-solve the puzzle which was easy but time consuming, and no way to save in between.  I died about 7 times to this boss, doing a 4 minute puzzle 7 times in a row was very cumbersome.- Although controls are mappable, quick time events are hard locked to use Q, E, F and spacebar.  I'm a dinosaur that uses arrow keys to move so it was a chore to move my hand over and find those keys in a timely fashion, and missing just one button press resulted in death.- There is a ledge climbing/shuffling mechanic which works well enough but it's really slow and becomes a chore if you fall and have to re-do sections. The combat is pretty fun but it relies heavily on melee combat.  The melee combat is fairly good overall, despite what others have said I felt like the weapons had impact and feedback.  The downside is that dodging is an essential part of combat and it becomes extremely easy to get caught on little corners of items around you, making you get stuck in place and hit.  It also became very frustrating during segment with multiple enemies that have the ability to knock you down, as you'd sometimes get caught in a string of knockdowns and unable to do much else. On to the pros:- This is just a very unique and overall fun game.  Combat is generally fun aside from the nagging issues I mentioned, I wish it had featured gunplay over melee.  At times you'd come across an area where it was just a couple of enemies at first and then more would join in and the music would ramp up and become louder and it all just worked really well to make combat enjoyable.  Kind of felt a little like Doom 2016 at times with the dodging and shooting/hitting, waiting for powers to cooldown, etc.- This game has the coolest looting mechanic to date, you simply hold a button down and it hoovers up all the loot in the area that you're looking at.  It's fun to watch doors and shelves fly open and that loot get hoovered right up.- Skill trees allow you various abilities such as a cryogenic jet which freezes enemies, Shok which shocks them and stuns them, polymer cannon which covers them in goo and can enhance other damage types, a temporary shield, and telekenesis which allows you to pick enemies up into the air.  If you want to reset your skills there's no penalty for doing so.- Guns can be upgraded and you can find attachments for them that improve stats or change functionality.- The environmental puzzles are good enough to be a stand alone game.  There are several ""testing ground"" areas where you solve a series of puzzles or win fights and there are bronze, silver and gold weapon upgrades as you proceed through each stage of the dungeon.  Even though I had completed the story I went back just to complete all of the testing grounds because I enjoy puzzles.- Speaking of puzzles many locked doors require a small and simple puzzle to be completed, usually clicking things to a certain timing or simple rotational puzzles, they were never very difficult.- The story was interesting and fairly unique i'll leave it at that to avoid spoilers.- Voice acting is good and the main character is relatable for a change, I often laughed at his jokes or insults, at times he did come across a bit whiny at times but overall the dialogue and back-and-forth with other characters was enjoyable. All in all I really enjoyed my time with the game.  If you become quickly frustrated with bugs you might wait until they patch it up a little more",Positive

4876,atomic-heart,24-Feb-23,7,"A solid effort by a new studio that puts some AAA studios to shame when it comes to performance, for the most part Atomic Heart runs incredibly well on PC, with only some minor traversal stutter outdoors and some wonky, low frame rate animations here and there. The majority of the game is spent indoors where the game runs flawlessly. The game is let down by a very unlikeable protagonist, an outdoor area that's so full to the brim with enemies that you're never given a chance to explore and a confusing, poorly written script. The game also has the most puzzles I have ever experienced in a video game, they're non stop and repeated throughout the entire game, it felt like every door had a locking mechanism that required you to do another puzzle, it became very tiresome. Gameplay was solid for the most part, with plenty of upgrades and unlocks to hunt for, but at times the game liked sending an overwhelming amount of enemies your way which just felt odd, at times it felt like a horde shooter which Atomic Heart definitely isn't. Overall I enjoyed my time with the game and I appreciate how well it runs after playing a slew of AAA titles that suffer from stuttering and poor optimisation. With a little work a potential sequel could be truly great.",Average
4877,atomic-heart,24-Feb-23,0,"First of all, it should be noted that this game has a nonsensical and absurd plot. It's hard to imagine how a story in a unique setting could be made so bad. However, the main problem of the game is its monotony and boredom. First of all, this concerns enemies and puzzles. It is not clear why there was an open world, because it is empty and not filled with activities. Also, throughout the game, the main character's constant comments with silly jokes were annoying. In general, I do not recommend, a waste of time and money.",Negative

4879,atomic-heart,24-Feb-23,9,"В игре неплохая графика и отличная оптимизация, всё выглядит потрясающе и работает без просадок (за исключением буквально 1-2 моментов в некоторых кат-сценах, но просадки там буквально единичные). Футуристический СССР и в целом лор игры проработаны хорошо, в игре очень много различных сайд-историй, которые можно узнать из текстовых терминалов и записывающих устройств (хотя, местами, их бывает ОЧЕНЬ много). Встречаются различные отсылки и просто приколы, вписаны они в игру хорошо и глаз от кринжа не режут. Геймплей сильно напоминает Prey 2017 года — нужно много лутать, крафтить, собирать себе снаряжение и готовиться к файтам самостоятельно. Для крафта доступна куча оружия + различные умения, которые в процессе игры можно менять по своему вкусу - любые ресурсы, затраченные на что-либо, можно вернуть обратно, отказавшись от предмета/способности, что позволяет перепробовать все доступные в игре абилки/оружие. Боевка достаточно динамичная, часто требуется комбинировать использование оружия и способностей, присутствует система уклонений (правда, примитивненькая). Но всё это полноценно прочувствовать можно только на максимальном уровне сложности, на низком/среднем враги практически не представляют опасности и их можно просто перестрелять. Босс-файты - нормальные, но ничего особенного. Порой были даже легче, чем обычные волны противников в открытом мире или на сюжетных локациях. Сайд-квесты достаточно однообразные, представляют собой лутание экспериментальных полигонов, на которых можно найти ресурсы и чертежи для крафта. К сожалению, они все сводятся к +- одним и тем же действиям и содержат в себе много платформинга, что, на мой взгляд, скорее минус. Загадки в них тоже очень однообразные. Иногда там могут быть мини-боссы. Багов в игре практически не встречал, разве что единичные застревания (но выбраться всегда удавалось) и прерывания диалогов (надеюсь, это пофиксят, т.к. бесило просто ужасно). Левел-дизайн местами вызывает вопросы — он бывает порой совсем неинтуитивен, типа того же входа в Театр — кто играл, думаю, поймёт. В целом, отличный экспириенс, с удовольствием провёл время. P.S. По продолжительности игра занимает где-то 20 часов с учётом всех сайд-квестов.",Positive
4880,atomic-heart,24-Feb-23,5,"Atomic Heart is a really conflicted game. During my entire playthrough, the processes it went through during development was so clear to see. Some things really feel like they're there just because they can be. Let's begin with a weird topic: NORA. This is a horny fridge that sexually harasses the main character P-3 whenever he interacts with it. And it is so easy to see that it was a last minute addition because the developers realized that people are mainly buying it for the ""hot robots."" There are some evidences towards this:1. They forgot to replace the subtitles P-3 and Charles have after meeting NORA. P-3 says NORA but the subtitles stay as fridge.2. P-3 talks like every fridge is NORA but NORA only appears at specific parts of the game to introduce some elements.3. Granny Zina talks about the fridge in her house like it's the only fridge unlike P-3's ""girlfriend"" NORA, but that default voice fridge has been all throughout the game. But NORA isn't the only last minute addition. There are parkour mechanics in the game. At the beginning there's a cool place that utilizes it, but after it not only do you see it so little, mostly they're just pointless. There's an entire parkour area that just lead you to the same room you started in. It might be a joke but feels more like they just forgot to put something there. Apart from the healing items (which you get ridiculous amounts of throughout the game), there are also food items. Only two of them though, as far as I could find. And not only are there so little of them, they start appearing only like halfway through the game. Why? Because they could put it in the game. They don't even give good bonuses. The main character is annoying. He never shuts up and says some of the most stupid things. Like, no one is going to start saying ""crispy critters"" bro, trust me. And at the very beginning of the game, apparently after that crash he goes unconscious for 2 days with no one looking after him. And while all that, not only did he not get killed by one of the thousands of robots wandering the area, he also survived without any food or water and is completely capable of killing hundreds more? And despite being a loudmouth, he never even mentions all the time he's missed? Really? The plasmid... I mean polymer abilities suck. There are 3 offensive and 2 defensive ones and that's it. Shok is the basic one you get at the start and it's the only one you'll ever need. Others are so pointless. There are 3 elements in the game; electric, cold, and fire. The Frosbite polymer sucks but why is there no ability for the fire element? There are already too little abilities, why not add one more? Abilities cost so little but they're just useless, you don't need any of them. The lore of the game, despite being a little cliche, was interesting to investigate. It got me invested in the game at the start. But the story being as stale as it is immediately crushed it for me. Eventually I stopped reading through journals and just walked by them. Been looking forward to some of the twists, most did happen but they couldn't be executed any worse. The biggest problem the game has, I think, is that it has no soul. Everything about it feels as empty as the robots you're fighting. It is sadly painfully mediocre, but weirdly not that bad. It looks great and is probably one of the most well optimized modern games of this era. The environments look beautiful, and weapon hit detection is great for most guns. Thankfully it came to gamepass day 1 though, because I would be pretty furious that I spent money for it.",Average

Из минусов и мне показалось что гг слишком много болтает с перчаткой и часто это надоедает очень сильно, а так-же мне не понравилась миссия с колбами и в начале, очень растянутой она мне показалось, а так игра очень даже хороша, не знаю из-за чего многие её захейтили",Positive

4894,atomic-heart,24-Feb-23,10,"Review bombing - 10/10 Optimization - 10/10. People tested it on Integrated Graphics. Still ran, mid settings, 60 fps. Top notch,  basically will run on a potato. Crashes? I had none so far. I'm like 8 hours in or so. 10/10Epicness - 12/10, man, I wish they had VR version for this Main character - 5/10, obnoxious honestly, wish they changed most of his uncalled comebacks. Upgrades - 6/10, good, not really pushing for more experimentation. You find something that works and kinda don't feel like trying other options. Art style - 11/10. Loved retro futuristic USSR. Gameplay overall - 8/10, overall is good. I wish they made main character faster. Dialogues - 5/10, mostly between main character and glove, that part at least could use more refine. Combat - 8/10, more satisfying when you get more guns on your hands, melee could use more combos. Story - 7/10, basically red alert kinda asylum. English dub - 6/10, it's ok, but could use Russian accent to help immersion. Puzzles - from 6 to 8. has lame ones, has smart ones, mostly good. Music - 10/10, soviet remixes kick ass. AI Pathfinding - 5/10, it's fun to watch tho. Prolly will get fixed. Characters - 7/10, mostly good, but everyone could use more development honestly. Bosses - 8/10, almost all bosses worked for me. Crazyness - freaking asylum 10/10 Thiccness - lawd have mercy 9/10 Enemies art design in general - 10/10 Worth your time? 8/10,  speaking generally it will take you for a ride you didn't get in a while. It's not perfect, some parts could use more polish, other parts take the breath away. Uniqueness? 9/10, pretty unique for latest tendencies' Tech issues:Crashes? I had none.FOV - should be adjustable from start, coming in next patch.CCs size - scheduled for fixes. Very small font so can't really enjoy Russian dub + CCs for immersion at start. Ray Tracing - coming in next patch, removed at start. Good decisions leveled out or made ignore some lame or not polished parts.

And it's been a great pleasure for me to finally play Atomic Heart. What`s even more interesting about this game, is that it managed to show this level of quality despite all the things it's development went through, despite its being the first game from the studio created in CIS, and despite all the controversy surrounding it. I was blown by all this love and care that was put into recreating all the little details of soviet aesthetic: from great music, to things like vending machine, serving sparkling water or lemonade. And the cherry on top was the whole style and humour of this game. I suppose it might seem vulgar for somebody, but I absolutely loved finally seeing this kind of humour and beautiful characters in AAA game oriented for Western market. Overall, this game left me absolutely satisfied, and I'm happy all this waiting paid off really well. 10/10",Positive

Отдельное слово про геймплей мне он очень понравился потому что я изначально думал смотря трейлеры что это игра будет прекрасной но геймплей будет отстой и как я рад что я был не прав очень бодрый темп игры и много разных геймплейных механик которые добавляют фана в игру но все же что мне не понравилось это как по мне очень маленький фов.

Der Kampf ist nicht so dynamisch wie in Doom 3, aber es passt zum Stil des Spiels und wird eher ein Plus als ein Minus sein.Es gibt nichts zu sagen über die Grafik - sie ist einfach angenehm, genau wie bei anderen kürzlich veröffentlichten Projekten. Optimierung - es ist schick , ich hätte nie gedacht , dass das moderne Gaming-Segment in der Lage ist, ein Spiel mit einer solchen Grafik zu veröffentlichen , die bei mittleren Einstellungen für eine 1060-Serie von Karten so gut funktioniert.Die Musik passt prägnant ins Spiel , da sie den russischen Geist richtig widerspiegelt. In den Kampfszenen wird temperamentvolles Metall gespielt, das den Kämpfen Antrieb und Spaß gibt. Fazit : Dieses Spiel ist definitiv Ihre Aufmerksamkeit wert , es sei denn , Sie sind sicherlich mit Russophobie und ""Preiselbeeren"" getränkt .",Positive

В этом плане игра отстала на лет 5.Сюжет: Ничего особого, просто скучный повод для пострелушек.Игра в целом: Каких-то оригинальных идей я не заметил, идею маскота украли из Fallout, почти вся игра слизана из Bioshock. Всё, чем запомнилось прохождение, это роботы близняшки.К покупке не рекомендую, по крайней мере за такие деньги. Battle: Guns isn't feels real, moving like in Faiiout 3.Graphic: Rarely looks god, but in many situations textures from 2016 will be shown.

4963,atomic-heart,24-Feb-23,10,"Итак, Atomic Heart. Лично я ждал эту игру с опаской. Это игра первый серьезный проект Mundfish, странные рекламные решения, выход игры в СНГ только в VKplay, слухи о плохой оптимизации, сеттинг - ведь в наше время можно видеть только плохие аспекты СССР.Но игра смогла меня приятно удивить. Приятный геймплей, возможность использовать весь арсенал, а не необходимость носиться в поисках патронов, к понравившемуся виду оружия.  Видов врагов много, они не надоедают. Сеттинг используется как любовная открытка советской науке и тем мечтам, которые она возлагала на будущее. Отсылки сделаны сугубо для людей из СНГ, на западе их и близко никто не поймет. Музыка просто прекрасна, если бы еще мою любимую “Звенит январская вьюга” переделали, я был бы в шоке. Посмотрев видео о создании музыки, от GeoffPlaysGuitar, я увидел, что ребята реально были заряжены сделать классно.  Ну и Мик Гордон молодец. Графика и оптимизация это ОБРАЗЕЦ для современных рукожопов, которые, почему то называют себя разработчиками AAA-игр.Из спорных моментов - сексуализация, я понимаю еще на западе люди жалуются. Там полный отрыв от реальности, со всеми леволиберальными ценностями и женщины в их играх теперь это аморфное нечто, но игроки и игрожур из России, вы то блин куда?))) Если у вас нет психических отклонений на сексуальной почве и вы в принципе взрослый человек, вы будете воспринимать замки в этой игре как забавный прикол, а роботов близняшек как фан сервис в каком нибудь аниме, не более. Ну а если вам может нанести душевную травму нимфоманка станция по прокачке оружия - повзрослейте или забейтесь в угол своей квартирки и никогда не выходите на улицу, там такое можно встретить уууу. Мат-перемат, а то тут у нас все такие эстеты собрались, прям иду по улице/университету/общественным местам и никогда не слышу мата, а тут ну прям не могу. Предъявлять игре минусы из разряда сексуализации, мата, пропаганды - по меньшей мере, лицемерие.Открытый мир - он тут в принципе не нужен, а от роботов в нем проще убежать, чем сражаться. Если бы игра была линейной ей бы пошло это на пользу. Иногда не понятно когда будет сражение с боссом и что лучше с собой к нему захватить, у меня была ситуация когда мне пришлось заваливать сражение и идти меня экипировку т.к. нечего другого не оставалось. Сюжет тут второстепенный и скорее едет на сеттинге, но дарит ярких персонажей и прикольные моменты так, что он на несколько голов выше многих последних западных проектов аля returnal и прочих.По большому счету игра на 8 из 10 и если у неё будет сиквел разработчики наверняка смогу сделать все идеально. Выражаю огромную благодарность всем разработчикам и желаю учесть все объективные проблемы с геймплеем и сюжетом. Ждем  DLC!А всем кто тут ищет пропаганду, особенно для выходцев из 404, - идите нахер.",Positive

4968,atomic-heart,24-Feb-23,9,"Good game. I love the world they’d created, and hope it will be more games and genres in this alternative universe. Good to see a real game with interesting and unique setting, working mechanics and good quality (which is not achievable for most of giants in this industry nowadays for some reason!). And sad to see dishonest reviews from press and users. Especially press, who pretend to be a good people and against terrible things like racism. But, it’s ok to rate the game much lower than it deserves just because it was made by Russians, and the world is alternative USSR. Such non-racist! But, it seems to be the same with hogwards legacy, when the game sells itself. Press and activists are nothing. Good luck to devs. You’ve made a great job.",Positive

В игре встречаются баги, но ничего, что не лечится перезагрузкой сохранения не встретил. Крайне рекомендую к покупке.",Positive
4970,atomic-heart,24-Feb-23,3,"The game is very stuffy, slow, opponents are incredibly strong and are just sponges that absorb damage, and you will be killed in 2 hits. Terrible optimization, with a weak level of graphics, textures are very often soapy, and a constant problem with reflections, which are not only of poor quality, but also lie on objects incorrectly. You don’t feel firearms at all, you shoot, as if with rubber bullets, opponents absolutely do not react to hits. Also bloated open spaces where there is ABSOLUTELY nothing to do, they are literally empty, all you can do there is run into a new bunch of opponents. The game certainly has its advantages. Interesting and colorful characters, interesting setting, lore and the story itself, but the main character is stuffy and not interesting at all, just a talking box through which we interact with the world and characters. In short, something like this. This is my subjective opinion, and I believe that this game deserves a maximum rating of 3 points.",Negative

The game turned out to be very juicy and high quality. I hope that Mundfish has enough money, motivation and script to continue and create a new franchise. those who write that the game is bad or something else, then it's not so clear. On the one hand, I agree that the balance in complexity suffers a lot, there are unfinished moments, but it's all just ridiculous compared to all the pluses. On the other hand, there are people who rate the game only because it was made by Russian developers, and this is the only thing that infuriates them in this game. I do not regret a single cent that I spent on this masterpiece. I recommend everyone to buy!",Positive

4974,atomic-heart,24-Feb-23,10,"To be honest, I expected less from this game, but in fact it turned out to be a pretty good game.Of the advantages:1. good graphics2. Very good optimization, I have a laptop with 3060 by 6GB ,16 RAM and a percentage of i7-11800h and everything goes on ultra settings.3. very cool soundtrack, songs of those times, pleasant voice acting.There are many references, for example, to ""well, wait""4. Very cool fighting woman Zina at the beginning (I hope everything is normal with her, since I played a little and I don't know what's wrong with her)5. Very cool loot system, I personally liked it. it's better than just walking up to the box, press F and that's it, and here are some cool animations of it.6. And of course sex.Robots are probably the best !Of the minuses:1. It's a little expensive so 1500 UAH for a regular editionChanged:I have never supported the Russian Federation, if you think that I bought the game and everything became a zombie, then I'm sorry. I have always been and will be for Ukraine.Stop writing that I am from Ukraine and bought it and supported the purchase of missiles.You have already become with this topic for games or music, like those who say ""8 years dammed the Donbass"", you are the same, you have one stuck ""There you bought a Russian. the game, you supported the murder or you're listening to Ross. ""you're a traitor"" is enough.Changed 2nd timeYou can continue to write out here that I rooster supported rashka and so on.I will not delete the review, I will not close the comments either.So you can further promote it to the top.

4975,atomic-heart,24-Feb-23,0,"In their official ad (!), this game has dared to compare itself to Hogwarts Legacy.Which is absolutely hilarious as Hogwarts Legacy is literally everything this game IS NOT. Writing:- This game's story is the definition of a placeholder. In fact, its just a bunch of MacGuffins instead to drive you from location to location.- Saying that the main ""protagonist"" is unlikable would be an understatement. Absolutely unrelatable, as he realizes what's happening several hours after the player does. The dumb lines he throws are all over the place (in this regard the game took over Forespoken BY FAR). It is quite noticeable the writers had very little idea what they wanted him to be, besides being 1) a some ""KGB officer"" (the Chekhov's gun never shot) 2) a ""brutal"" man (so they come up with a 11-years old boy in an adult body).- The ""humor"" in this game... Well, if you would laugh on somebody slipping on a banana skin, there is a chance you will appreciate some of it. Gameplay:- The ""open world"" (I would rather call it ""open space"") is absolutely empty and pointless. Clearly added only to tick the checkbox for ""the modern audience"".- After several hours in, fights and enemies become so repetitive and boring. Other- No FOV slider - this will make some players feel sick on regular monitors and is absolutely unplayable on ultra-wide. SummaryYou can clearly see that huge money were put into the game, but it's a shiny (and fairly well-polished) shell with nothing nearly pleasant inside. What was in advertisement stayed there. Would have never bough it even for 20 bucks and selling it for 60$.. it must be yet another cringy joke from the writers. I would advice everyone not to get hooked on the adds and trailers and just stay away from this piece of software.",Negative

4987,atomic-heart,23-Feb-23,0,"Atomic Heart is a first-person shooter game that takes place in a captivating retro-futuristic Soviet world that blends advanced technology with the style of the Soviet Union era. The game features a unique setting with a distinctive atmosphere, and the nostalgia-inducing elements, such as Soviet-era cars, architecture, and culture, add an extra layer of charm to the game. While the shooting mechanics of Atomic Heart could use some improvement, the game's closed locations are well designed and provide an enjoyable and action-packed gameplay experience. Additionally, obtaining new weapon blueprints can feel like a bit of a chore, but the game's unique atmosphere and storyline make up for the shortcomings in the gameplay mechanics. One of the standout features of Atomic Heart is its soundtrack, which features popular songs with a distinctly Russian vibe, such as ""Arlekino"" by Pugacheva, ""Trava u doma"" by Zemlyane, and classic animated series ""Nu, pogodi!"". These cultural elements add to the game's authenticity and create a unique and immersive experience for players. Moreover, the inclusion of Soviet-era cars, such as the ""Moskvich,"" adds to the game's overall appeal. As someone who has a personal connection to the car, seeing it in the game brought back many fond memories and added an extra layer of nostalgia and sentimentality to my gameplay experience. Overall, while Atomic Heart has its drawbacks, it is still a highly recommended game for players who are looking for a unique and captivating gaming experience. The game's incorporation of cultural elements, nostalgic elements, and the overall atmosphere make up for its flaws, providing an enjoyable and immersive gameplay experience.",Negative

4999,atomic-heart,23-Feb-23,10,"Overall it is a good game though it is probably closer to an 8/10. I'm about 4-5 hours into the game. The combat feels good in terms of fluidity but it can become a bit stale after a while. Definitely need to keep on top of upgrades and abilities to keep it fresher and be able to compete with stronger enemies. I personally don't mind the protagonist as a character; it can be hard for some to relate to him but once you realize he's a product of his environment, it makes more sense why he is the way he is. The dialogue can be pretty rough though which I think is the game's biggest flaw. Switch to Russian and use subtitles and problem is solved though. Story-wise it's not bad, maybe a little predictable at times but still interesting. The game itself is gorgeous and the art style is wonderful. The character models are great, especially for the more obscure robot types. It also runs very well from a performance standpoint which is very refreshing compared to other games lately. I've run into a couple of bugs so far including getting stuck between objects and not being able to get out and the NORA machine's menu not popping up as well as not being able to get out of that screen. Forced me to either reload a previous save or relaunch the game all together. Also, a robot fell halfway through the floor and couldn't get out.  If they can fix these bugs and put a little more polish on it in general, I think this game has the potential to be a 9/10. If you're a fan of its predecessors like BioShock, the newer Doom games, Wolfenstein... etc., you'll love this game. If you want an open-world game like most other games these days, then you probably won't. Contrary to popular belief, this is not an open-world game and never claimed to be. It is a narrative experience with larger open areas and has a linearity associated with that genre (like its predecessors) that helps keep the player engaged in the story and not distracted by other locations and rinse and repeat side quests. Giving this game a 10/10 because of all the review bombers.  A solid game from Mundfish as their first AAA IP they've released!",Positive

Crashes and progression loss (save file not working). The first boss fight (Ball on arena) was pretty good, but all others were super boring, same with the plot. They started with great ideas and concepts, but the ""open world"" looks so dull and generic, the enemies were just ""dropped"" on the map without any reason. In almost the whole game, I've seen strange artifacts on walls/shots/other effects. Closer to the end looks like they just don't know how to end this story, scenario turns wild super-scientist is also a ballet genius. The ending looks like a piece of ... you will not have anything you want to see in the end. Maybe if Mundfish will patch the game to reduce problems with stability and other bugs it could be okay-ish 6-7 points game. The plot is really bad in culmination and looks so strange, and unfinished or dropped.",Negative

И я даже не про бан СНГ игроков в стиме и кидалово с предзаказами.Не про отвратительный резил в ВК плее, который не выдерживает не только критики, но и нагрузки.Я про саму игру.1. Нет 50% звуков окружений, как в катсценах, так и непосредственно в игре.Например: лифт бабы зины падает без звука, но с искрами. Предметы поднятые телекинезом ударяются с эффектами разрушений/частиц , но так же без звука. И так до бесконечности.2. Частые вылиты без ошибок и сомнительная оптимизация. Мыльноватая игра в 60 фпс - это не оптимизация.3. У НПС одинаковые лица, а стартовая локация которая должна подарить вам атмфосферу, фулл забита каким-то абсурдным безумием. Вспомните роботов на беговой дорожке в самом начале игры, и то, что перед ними на ТРЁХ мониторах. Какие, ****Ь, заблокированные двери и потерянный к ним доступ?)))4. ГГ - былдо. Очень глупое, карикатурное и стереотипное. Его действия, слова и мысли не согласуются друг с другом.  Самый простой пример: ГГ считает чуть ли не честью работать на главного учёного. При этом, такого же работягу как он, он презирает, т.к. тот ""шестёрка"". Лол, что?)5. Абсолютно напрочь убитая логика. На двери висит замок, но он ФИЗИЧЕСКИ ни как дверь не закрывает. При этом, пока ты его не снимешь, ты по какой-то причине не можешь просто потянуть дверь на себя.6. До абсурда безмозглый ИИ. В катсценах вовчики устраивают хитрые ловушки и садистки убивают людей. В игре, они застревают в дверном проёме, бегая туда-сюда, пока ты не спровоцируешь его атаковать тебя в ударом. Этот список можно продолжать долго.

The character's abilities are well shown and implemented in mechanics.  The plot is worthy of special attention, it is thought out to the smallest detail.  Well, the main thing is to say that this is the best optimization of the game at the start (and not only).  The game is perfectly balanced and thought out, causes only positive emotions.",Positive
5019,atomic-heart,23-Feb-23,2,"I'm struggling to put a finger on exactly what kind of awfulness we're dealing with here. The plot can't even be described as bad; it's just plain dull. And don't even get me started on the protagonist - what a numbskull. As for the gameplay, it's a tedious cycle of running between uninspired tasks that make drinking coffee feel like a monumental achievement. There's no immersion to be had here, no sense of impact - it might impress someone who's never played a video game before, but for anyone else, it falls flat. And while the graphics are passable in some instances, they hardly push any boundaries. There are some stylistic moments that stand out, but the rest is nothing to write home about unless you're a die-hard fan of Soviet aesthetics - and even they will tire of it before long. This game might have been impressive back in 2007, or even five years ago, but in today's market, it's just not worth the price of admission.

Both run extremely well w/fast loading, no shader cache stuttering whatsoever (Thank you devs!!) and it just looks Beautiful! From the insanely intriguing and sometimes super ""edgy-creeepy-scary bc it could have been real.."" game world to the physco robots (especially the Bosses), everything just works and is all you could ask for in a game world and story.The sound too is superb with some really naughty and delightful dialogue from your robot ""friend"", as well as cool ""techy"" commentary from the scientists, Great, Mature remarks from the main character, etc., and the sound of the world, characters interacting in the game world, etc. are amazing with a pair of Atmos headphones or an Atmos home theater. I REALLY Enjoy the story and put in about 15hrs on my first delve into the game.  It's like a mix of Wolfenstien, BioShock/System Shock and something wholely its own that ultimately make this an early GoY contender. P.S. This game runs really well (mostly, a VRR display would help in some crazy areas) on the Xbox Series S as well.  If I had to play it on a last gen console I would, but nextgen consoles and PC are the way to go if you've got em.  Highly recommend this for anyone who wants a new an amazing story/game to experience.

Shame the developers didn't take a closer look at how they did things. Suffice to say, wasted potential.",Negative
5032,atomic-heart,23-Feb-23,10,"If I were to describe the game in one word, it would be ""good"".Dev version leaked a while ago had problems, most of which like combat balance, audio bugs, too little loot, interaction bugs and others were mostly fixed at release. Overall, great job with finishing touches, considering only a few months have passed. Graphics are good, 8-9/10, Mundfish really did their homework on this one. For the most part, the game looks amazing. Audio is great too, if we exclude the bugs (most of which got fixed anyway), I'd say it's a firm 8/10 for overall audio and 9/10 for sound design.Combat system has its problems, overall it's good and fun, but it takes a lot of time to adjust to it. Powers and upgrades are well-made, can't say anything bad about them. Problems are mostly noticed in guns and dodging (mostly guns). It's not critical, but still, 7/10 for guns, 9/10 for powers, and I guess 7-8/10 overall. The game is undoubtedly fun when it gets going, got lost in some locations a few times, but it's not much of an issue considering that they are very well-made. And here's for the next point. Design. Here I'll address something.This game stands on the vibes, vibes of idealized retro-futuristic Soviet Union.If there is any ideology in the game - it's anti-Soviet one, just like in every other game since the beginning of gaming as we know it. Bad party, lies, etc. This game has nothing close to propaganda, some flattery towards China is all I noticed, and that is most likely for Chinese players.But man, VIBES, vibes in this game are fantastic. Devs have managed to hit a nostalgic Soviet spot like no others did before.You can walk through locations and see the inspirations they took in, for example Buzludzha and VDNH. They nailed everything they could about design and environment.After all, that was the plan from the beginning. 10/10. I could go on and on with this game, but I'll stop here. I decently recommend it to anyone who is into this kind of games.My score is probably between 8 and 9/10, but I'll score 10/10 just to counter the zeros from people who for whatever reason believe that 15 years of all the Developer's hard labor and tremendous work their big and multinational team have putted into this game should be scored 0 because this game gives ""wrong vibes"" to them.",Positive

There is nothing superfluous, the worked out dialogs, there are no stupid dialogues and quests as in Fallout 4 in which the dialogs were written as if the students of primary grades .. good mechanics of the game as a sip of fresh air after any already tired run shoot. In the game, there is a physicist, after so many games with welded objects to the floor, physics was again returned to the games, since the time it controlled the feeling that these were the lost technologies of the ancient civilizations of the Half-Life. Not bad graphics, but the main filling and scale of the game, plus it is not a corridor shooter as a metro, which is very pleased to feel freedom, puzzles, mini stories, everything is very concise ...",Positive
5070,atomic-heart,23-Feb-23,10,"Без Спойлеров!!! Хотел бы начать с минусовВ игре очень непонятная карта, во время паркура персонаж ощущается как дерево, полу окрытый мир довольно скучен на исследования, когда сражаешься с роботами постоянно прилетаю другие роботы чтобы их чинить и помогает только прокаченный телекинез. Есть душные миссии по типу: Принеси 4 колбы найди части тела робота и вообще 1 треть игры довольно душновата. Ну а теперь перейдём к плюсамИгра очень красивая! Я сейчас не про графику а про наполнение мира разными вещами которые присуще ссср. Роботы почти все выглядят офигенно, ну и конечно Близняшки! За это надо игре сделать отдельный плюс (Да ребят мы живем в такое время когда красивые женьщины это роскошь). Оружие очень крутое, ближнего и дальнего боя, оружие очень хорошо ощущается и стреляется. Да его в игре не так много но его хватает. Прокачка тоже выполненна довольно справедливо- Если хочешь прокачать пушку(Сделать лучше урон и уменьшить отдачу то просто иди по сюжету и кайфуй) а если хочешь увеличь урон электрический дулом или поставить прицел с типловизором, то будь добр ходить на полигоны и лутаться(но спасибо что хоть подписали где какой модуль находится и не нужно его искать по всей карте). Сюжет по началу ничем особенным не выделяется есть П-3(мы) который служит главному ученому Сеченову. На предприятие случается сбой и все роботы сходят с ума и начинают убивать людей а нас отправляют с этим разобраться. Как я и сказал первая треть игры довольно скучна-не разнообразного оружия ни интересных заданий ни прокаченных способностей но чем дальше тем интересней а финал... Скажу так вы точно его не предугадаете и вы будете в полнейшем шоке. Вот такая игра получилась, да она далеко не идеальна, много моментов можно переделать, подтянуть немного оптимизацию хотя она довольно хорошая, если посмотреть на релизы других крупных студий за последние 2 года. Как мне кажется для первого проекта студии очень не плохо! Придя на этот сайт я думал поставить оценку 8 но увидя что большенство негативных оценок из-за политики и войны на Украине я поставлю 10 ведь мне становится жалко разработчиков. Ребят у них первый трейлер по игре вышел 5 лет назад разрабы не пропагандируют СССР и Россию попробуйте абстрагироваться от войны и перестать пытаться найти вещи на которые можно обидеться и просто поиграйте в игру!",Positive
5071,atomic-heart,23-Feb-23,0,"Atomic Heart is an absolute letdown of a game that fails to deliver on almost every level. The game's concept and premise seemed promising, but the execution is so poor that it's hard to find anything redeeming about it.First of all, the game's technical issues are a major obstacle that makes it almost unplayable. From the constant frame rate drops to the never-ending loading screens, it's clear that the developers didn't put much effort into optimizing the game for modern hardware.Furthermore, the game's combat is a complete mess. The clunky controls and unresponsive mechanics make it frustrating to fight even the simplest of enemies. The game's AI is also terrible, making it easy to exploit their predictable behavior and making the game feel repetitive and dull.But perhaps the biggest disappointment of all is the game's story. The plot is convoluted and nonsensical, and the characters are uninteresting and forgettable. The game's attempts at humor fall flat, and the overall tone of the game is just confusing.Overall, Atomic Heart is a game that simply isn't worth your time or money. It's an unpolished mess that fails to deliver on every level, and there are far better games out there that are worth your attention.And yeah - this game is full of soviet/russian propaganda. Avoid at all cost.",Negative

5105,atomic-heart,23-Feb-23,1,"Atomic Heart has been one of the most anticipated games in recent years, with its impressive trailers and stunning visuals, but unfortunately, it fails to deliver on the gameplay front. Despite its potential, the game falls short in almost every aspect of its gameplay mechanics. First and foremost, the combat system is clunky and unresponsive. The hit detection is unreliable, making it difficult to accurately land a hit on enemies, and the overall combat system lacks depth and strategy. It feels like a chore to engage in any combat encounter, and it's clear that the developers didn't put enough effort into fine-tuning this crucial aspect of the game. The AI of the enemies is equally disappointing. They lack any form of intelligent decision-making, often running straight towards the player with no regard for their own safety. It's as if the developers forgot to program any sort of basic AI behavior. Additionally, the game is riddled with technical issues, including frequent crashes, bugs, and glitches that can completely ruin the immersion. The game is also poorly optimized, causing frequent frame rate drops and lag, which is especially frustrating during combat encounters. The story of Atomic Heart is intriguing, but it's bogged down by tedious and repetitive gameplay. The side quests are uninspired, and the main storyline fails to fully engage the player due to the monotonous gameplay. In all honesty, I cannot recommend Atomic Heart to anyone. Despite its stunning graphics and intriguing storyline, the gameplay is so poorly executed that it ruins any potential the game had. The clunky combat system, unintelligent AI, technical issues, and tedious quests make for an overall frustrating and disappointing experience. It's clear that the developers focused more on the game's aesthetics than on the gameplay, and it's a shame because with more effort and attention to detail, it could have been a great game. In its current state, however, Atomic Heart is simply a bad game that falls short in almost every aspect. Save your time and money and look elsewhere for a more enjoyable gaming experience.",Negative

5135,atomic-heart,23-Feb-23,10,"AAA game made by newbie developers from the CIS. Atomic Heart uses concept of USSR in 50-s. The feeling of nostalgia for most post-soviet players will make you feel great, everything is made very well in terms of atmoshpere. Developers used common sense making characters in game. You can remember a lot of characters that you meet during the walkthrough. Some humans, your smart hand, even some robots. I like the design. There are a lot of jokes, dialoges, text stories and audio records. Bad thing that some of them can be skipped just by walking into random map trigger, which causes any audio to stop, so players have to wait if they want to know everything about this world. Gunplay is amazing. You can customize your abilities, upgrade you character, upgrade you guns. Hitreg is made pretty good for both melee and long-range weapons. Players have to grind a lot of resources to keep up with strong enemies. Grinding is important thing at the begging of the game, because robots are very thick and it's difficult to defeat them using non upgraded stuff. Mid-game, players will have important upgrades, that'll make gameplay way more interesting. Some puzzles are quite interesting. Some puzzles are required to open additional paths and items, some to continue the story. The optimisaton is great.

5137,atomic-heart,23-Feb-23,7,"Игра неплохая. Самым большим минусом для меня были диалоги. Словно их писали в последнюю очередь, либо сценаристом наняли родственника одного из руководителей.Особенно когда всё это смотрится на контрасте: главный герой как быдло матерится через слово, а все вокруг вежливо и культурно пытаются его успокоить, аки бухого батю который с матами у всех деньги на бутылку вымогает.Ну и бабка ещё не понравилась. Почему бабку озвучивает словно 30-летняя женщина которая даже не пытается разговаривать как бабка? Почему бабка такое же быдло? Сценарист не знает правила контраста? Ты можешь сделать бабку смешной, если сделаешь её действительно бабкой, старенькой, сутуленькой, слабенькой, вежливой, которая резко может орду роботов замочить. Но в игре бабка это не бабка, это тот же самый главный герой но в платочке. Остальное в игре в целом понравилось либо не раздражало. Многие ругали то что очень мало видов врагов, да, но меня это не сильно напрягало.Были технические проблемы со звуком, баг это или нет - не знаю, но она то пропадает то появляется. За это оценку снижать не хочу, учитывая что это первая игра в этом году которая хорошо оптимизирована и на насилует компьютер.",Average

Обычная игрушка категории B- не оправдывающая всего хайпа, который на неё свалился. Ставить высшую оценку игре, только потому что она типа Российская - величайшая глупость. И кстати Atomic Heart не российская игра, разработчики всячески от этого открещиваются и не указали, что в команде есть разработчики чисто с Российским Паспортом.

The graphics and visual effects are not bad, but in 2023 there are many games with better visual.The worst part, IMHO, is a many of the Soviet Union and Russian stuff in the game. And I understand the genre with mixing some old things with AI and robot. It looks cool, but not in this game.

5147,atomic-heart,23-Feb-23,2,"Atomic Heart is a game that failed to live up to my expectations. While the developers tried to create an immersive gaming experience, they seemed to have relied too heavily on the propaganda of the Soviet Union and Russia, instead of focusing on creating an interesting and engaging gameplay. Additionally, the game suffers from an over-reliance on stolen elements from other games, particularly from Bioshock. One of the main problems with Atomic Heart is that it lacks originality. The game feels like a mishmash of other popular games, rather than being something unique and exciting. It's clear that the developers were heavily influenced by Bioshock, with many gameplay mechanics and design elements being taken directly from that game. Moreover, given the current political climate, it is not ethical to support a game created by a country currently involved in an aggressive and expansionist war. It's important to be mindful of the games we choose to play and the message we send when we play them. Overall, I cannot recommend Atomic Heart due to its lack of originality, over-reliance on stolen elements, and the ethical concerns around supporting games created by countries involved in wars of aggression.",Negative

Dialogues are kinda cringe; enemies have some nice designs, but fighting them gets tedious way too fast; and the open world part is just a chore to go through, even though it can be beautiful. Then there's the ending, it was the most underwhelming part since Mass Effect 3.Not to mention the developers, while claiming to be out of politics, have put references like old photos of Donetsk, canned pork with upside down ukrainian flag as a background, and a drone with a geranium as a reference to shahed drones (russian Geran' 2) that russians use to bomb ukrainian cities.

The official released version runs like butter. It actually surprised me that I can play the game on 4K with settings on ""Atomic"" with an AMD 3600 and AMD 6800 between 60 and 90 fps. So you are playing on a developer debug version or you are simply lying.Game looks beautiful, no woke characters, just a blast.

The beginning sequence is beautiful from an art perspective. The game looks really good. Gameplay wise it just doesn’t hold up, spongy enemies, endless mob waves in open world, melee weapons aren’t that viable the harder the difficulty. And constantly collecting mats from dead bodies and drawers. It’s worth a shot on game pass for “free”, wouldn’t pay more than $15 bucks for it. Definitely has bioshock vibes and the art style is cool but gameplay is repetitive and boring. Story wise I can already tell what’s gonna happen 3 hours in nothing special. Main character isn’t somebody you can really relate to. Way to edgy all the time.For their first game mundfish did a good job I’ll say that, it also takes a lot to impress me. It’s better than most of the AAA **** that comes out nowadays from major studies. Overall just wait till it goes on sale if you want to play it.

5203,atomic-heart,22-Feb-23,0,"Atomic Heart is an absolute disaster of a video game. From start to finish, this game is an unmitigated mess that is sure to disappoint even the most forgiving of players. First and foremost, the game is plagued with technical issues that make it almost unplayable. From constant crashes to sluggish performance, you'll spend more time trying to get the game to work than actually playing it. The graphics, while promising in trailers and teasers, are underwhelming and unimpressive in practice, and the overall design of the game is lackluster and unoriginal. But even if you manage to get past the technical issues, the gameplay is a complete letdown. The combat is clunky and unresponsive, and the AI is so terrible that it makes the game feel like it was made in the 90s. The game's story is convoluted and poorly executed, leaving the player with little to no investment in the game's world or characters. Overall, I would not recommend Atomic Heart to anyone. This game is a complete waste of time and money, and there are far better games out there that are actually worth your time.

5209,atomic-heart,22-Feb-23,5,"Una historia sin sentido, una jugabilidad frustrante y repetitiva, y un juego que al fin prometía demasiado y se termino quedando corto en casi todo departamento.Como una gran ola Atomic Heart tiene un comienzo de lujo, es fantásticamente bien desarrollado, con grandes detalles en los graficos y el diseño de arte, hace un buen trabajo en adentrarte a su mundo, a su temática, a su premisa, todo perfecto y después el juego tiene un gran giro.Por ser un juego en ruso, decidí jugar el juego con las voces en ruso, lo cual fue una buena decisión considerando que el doblaje al ingles es pesimamente malo –además de que no me gusta jugar o ver nada que no sea en su lenguaje original-, denme subtitulos en mi idioma y todo lo demás en el original de los creadores, es lo que digo.Después de la introducción se presentan unos personajes buenos que prometen mucho y que terminan por ser mal utilizados por el resto del juego, no se ven muchos de ellos sino hasta los momentos conclusivos del juego. Cuando se terminan apareciendo, es en contextos abstractos en donde el juego ha rebasado cualquier poco sentido que tenía en principio, en cambio los personajes son actores en un escenario que no tiene sentido.La jugabilidad esta compuesta en dos partes, al inicio los niveles son lineales y cerrados, cosa que es buena por que demuestra las habilidades que los diseñadores tenían, es verdad que necesitaban un cambio de ambiente después de un cierto tiempo, pero lo que ofrecen aquí es de lo peor, por que cambian el diseño del juego después de seis horas de jugarlo, pasa de ser una experiencia enfocada y lineal, a un juego que trata de implementar elementos de pseudo mundo abierto; pero estos elementos no están presentados, ni introducidos con ninguna lógica, muchos de ellos parecen estar -incluso-, inacabados.El mapa no funciona, resta mucha funcionalidad, no tiene marcadores, a veces marcadores que están en el propio juego al jugarlo, desaparecen por completo al abrir el mapa. Hay sistemas que el juego introduce que se utilizan quizá unas tres veces en total, literalmente, uno de ellos bastante peculiar en donde tienes que acceder a cámaras para abrir compuertas, cosa que se te explica una vez en un pequeño tutorial al comienzo del mundo abierto y después desaparece.Además, el mundo abierto tiene un sistema arbitrario y absurdo de alarmas, si te ven una de las cámaras mencionadas, se alertan a los robots que hay en el mundo, estos te persiguen sin importar cuanto corras, puedes tratar de ser mas sigiloso y estratégico; destruir cámaras, tratar de derrotar a tus enemigos de formas silenciosas utilizando un método extraño y obtuso para hacerlo que depende de eventos que demandan que presiones un botón de una manera irritantemente rápida. Pero no importa, si destruyes las cámaras, a los tres o cuatro segundos, vienen libélulas cibernéticas que las restauran y reintegran a donde estaban. No hay manera de evitar esto.Los puzles y acertijos que te encuentras también varían mucho, hay unos donde los conceptos son completamente únicos y bastante divertidos de interactuar con ellos, mientras que hay otros donde sus diseños e instrucciones son confusas, además de estar llenas de contrariedades, otros simplemente funcionan sin explicarte bien muchos de sus sistemas y funcionamiento; casi los resuelves sin pensar demasiado.Mucho del combate es bueno, no tengo problemas con el combate mas allá de que en partes tardías y conclusivas del juego el balance de dificultad y de recursos varia mucho, además de que el juego comienza a presentar unos muy buenos diseños de enemigos que tienen una lógica en el mundo y una presentación única y después los enemigos simplemente se presentan como cualquier otro enemigo, sin contexto, sin presentación particular, simplemente se aparecen y funcionan de las maneras más mundanas y mediocres.Aún así, debo decir que las armas y las mejoras que uno puede obtener de ellas son buenas, el problema es que muchas están en distintas localidades del mundo abierto y te requieren que te desvíes del camino, por un lado, y que por el otro, te enfoques en completar una serie de puzles bastante tediosos, es como si todo lo que no servía para las misiones principales se relego a estas localidades alternativas y opcionales.Atomic Heart es un juego muy variado, muy roto en el medio, es un juego que parece haber sido creado por dos grupos de diseñadores, unos que sabían lo que hacían, y el resto que estaba para sabotear ese trabajo.

5213,atomic-heart,22-Feb-23,7,"After dedicating approximately 17 hours to playing the game, completing the main campaign, and tackling some of the side content, I have mixed feelings about it. While the environment and setting of the game are undeniably impressive and breathtaking, and the music is nothing short of amazing, there are a number of flaws and issues that detract from the overall experience. The main issue lies in the story, dialog, and game-play loop. At first, the story appears intriguing and captivating, but as the game progresses, some of the characters and their motivations begin to feel nonsensical and random. It's evident that the later half of the game feels rushed and not well thought out. It's like a bright candle that slowly starts to fizzle out, leaving you wanting more. The dialog spoken by the main character you play as is also problematic. The protagonist is an unapologetic douchebag who is often unnecessarily rude to other characters who are trying to help him. This makes it hard to feel any real sense of tension in the story, as you are left feeling indifferent towards the unlikeable and bumbling character you control. While there are a few instances where his behavior leads to funny moments or jokes, these instances do little to make up for the overwhelming amount of time he spends being insufferable. The game's combat system, which is the primary aspect of the gameplay, is a mixed bag. While some aspects of the combat are excellent, others fall short. It appears as though the game is trying to blend the weapon swapping and movement mechanics of Doom Eternal with the powers of Bioshock. The enemies are fascinating and unique, but after a while, the repetitive nature of fighting them becomes boring. Many of the enemies are overly tanky, making them more of a nuisance than a real challenge (given I went through the game on the hardest difficulty). While the guns, powers, and weapons feel great to use, their impact on the enemies can sometimes feel underwhelming and disproportionate. Overall, while the game has some great features, such as the environment, music, and combat mechanics, the flawed story, dialog, and character development detract from the overall experience.",Average

5215,atomic-heart,22-Feb-23,10,"Atomic Heart is an ode to Soviet futurism, an ode to unfulfilled hopes. The developers tried to take the best from such games as Bioshock, Prey, Half-Life. I think they succeeded, though with some reservations, because this is the first game from the studio, which consists mainly of inexperienced developers, beginners in the game industry. And the more joyful it becomes that these newcomers were able to bring something new to the video game industry, which has been stagnant in ideas for several years now.",Positive

5217,atomic-heart,22-Feb-23,4,"Atomic Heart - A game with a unique style: beautiful, bewitching. And... That's it, that's all there is in this game.Well, you can still highlight the bosses, where the game is revealed from the best side, but more on that later. Open world: beautiful but empty. There is nothing to do. All mechanics of the open world are used ONLY at the entrances to the bunkers, in which there are weapons / attachments for weapons, that's all, there is nothing else. Puzzles: simple. Mobs: From extreme to extreme, that's how you can characterize the fight with them. What do I mean by this - If at the beginning you poke them for half an hour, then towards the middle of the game you almost one-shot them. Few types of enemies. (Worth noting, fighting late game with 5+ enemies is fun) Bosses: The only real thing in this game is where it's really fun to fight. The hedgehog is the top one, most likely for the music and the unfinished staff (Weapon/Skills) (IMHO). Melee/Firearm weapons: There are few of them, you don't feel it, well, it doesn't feel, yes but no, it's a little better than bad, so much so that when you have a mega melee weapon in your hands, it feels like it's a piece of wood. A little better with a firearm, average. Sorry for the tautology. Skills: Are they needed at all? No, really, they can only be useful at the beginning of the game, when it's hard for you, long and tedious to kill mobs, and then what? Pumping: the main problem of this game, and for which it becomes more and more boring to play, due to the fact that it becomes so easy to play that it is already boring. This item includes both the pumping of the Persian and weapons / skills. Plot: average. The plot is kind of interesting, the characters are funny, and the presentation is **** more than half of the story is scattered around the world / bunkers, on terminals. I am still silent that if you accidentally touch the trigger of a new dialogue, then the old one will simply stop. Musical accompaniment: Well, everything is clear without comment, it's cool. Not only were there old cool songs, for example, by the same Pugacheva, but also the sound from Mick Gordon (Tracks from DOOM). Conclusion: the game is a maximum of one time, boring. A lot of problems. Completed the game on Armageddon difficulty with no deaths.",Negative

Like the protagonist.- Aliens universe.- Cinematics are cool. They unwrap the story well.- Some references to the Alien: Isolation. Especially with the synthetics, and their design.- Gradual raise of difficulty. Cons.:- Absolutely ridiculous anticlimactic ending.- Too many static characters in the game.- Some upgrades do not make any sense and are never used.- Alien movement almost always lead to you.- Too many bugs like wasting your precious tools or aliens stuck in front of an unfinished wield of the door. You have to reload the whole last batch of action, which is a waste of time for sure.- The worst part probably is the last mission. You grind your way, trying to play best to have a mission with invulnerable characters with minimum abilities.

With the modest price tag of $40 it is more than worth it. It's a tough game sure, but only if you go in guns blazing and play on higher difficulties. The developers should be commended for crafting an original and FUN experience. A sequel that builds on the strengths of this game would be amazing.

Regarding presentation, voice acting is _really_ bad, at times actors read their lines like in children cartoon or puppet show, breaking immersion.

Like XCOM, but with real-time combat, greater focus on squad tactics, and large hand-crafted maps with over 10 objectives per map. I've played dozens of different games in the strategy/tactics genre, and this is the first game that took me 3 evenings to complete the first mission on Hard difficulty. Your marines have many tools at their disposable, but they are physically frail and prone to injury, dismemberment, abduction, and permanent death. On top of this, you have to manage their stress levels. Injuries and drawn-out conflicts can rapidly increase their stress levels, which left unchecked will develop into long-lasting traumas that negatively impact performance in various ways. The horror movie-like lighting and sound effects combine to recreate the atmosphere of tension that the Aliens movies are known for. There are four difficulty settings ranging from reasonably relaxed to deeply taxing, and their individual parameters can be tweaked as desired to create your own custom difficulty. A large update was released yesterday which fixes a slew of bugs, and adds a few features.

ADD pulls a lot of inspiration from a lot of really good games and combines them in a setting that's respectful of the source material while doing a great job of feeling like an actual Aliens bug hunt. The mission objectives get added on as your squads discover more of the colony/infestation, and it really does have a great , progressive feeling of being a dynamic campaign that is changing in scope as you learn more about it. I've never played a strategy game before where I'll go in expecting to accomplish x objective, but will instead discover some valuable items then fend off a brutal alien attack and need to extract - then come back the next day with a fresh squad and finish what I came to do. It just feels good. The only really major thing that I don't like is the stealth. When your squad is detected, the xenos will begin hunting you for a period of time, and I don't feel like there's enough options to avoid being spotted. That said, this isn't Thief, this is a game about state-of-the-badass-art marines blowing up bugs, so I understand why sneaking around isn't a huge focus. I really like it, at least so far.

The game is incredibly challenging and it sucks to lose a marine you invest a lot of resources into due to permadeath. Dialogue is great, some people have labelled it cheesey but I didn't have an issue with it. There were moments in cutscenes that I was on the edge of my seat and jumping scared, just like the movies. The game is faithful to the canon while still taking its own creative liberties that won't upset die hard fans.

But here are the cons: The UX/UI just feels unpolished and often confusing. I'm not going to go through all of my nitpicks here because there would be a list of 100 tiny issues that wouldn't be an issue by themselves. The game just needed more playtesters with a fresh eye to tell them what was confusing. Next is the sound. Sure, there are some sound aspects that are good, but there are a lot of missed opportunities. For a game of aiming for these fidelity, I was expecting more sound effects for the xenomorphs' claws climbing and walking on the metallic floors, but no sound effects at all. Next, the animations. The xenomorphs looked like they had no weight to them at all, as they walked around, it looked like their body was just floating along as smooth as a chicken's head while they walked silently. Next, they need to do something about that incessant and annoying soldier banter shouting after every other click to move. Most of the time you're sneaking anyway, and then you just hear the same soldier shouting at the top of his lungs while a xenomorph is right on the other side of the wall. Ideally, there should have been 2 sets of voiced acted lines, 1 while in stealth, and 1 while detected. As a compromise, there should have at least been a separate banter volume slider in the settings to just turn off the banter altogether.",Average

5243,aliens-dark-descent,22-Jun-23,7,IMO this game nails the sense of of tension that the series is known for while also making the action sections feel satisfying as well. You feel like there’s multiple viable strategies for completing each mission. It’s punishing yet you always have ways to get out of tough situations you’ve worked yourself into. There’s some negatives though. The games more than a little glitchy. I’ve only had to quit out once and the rest are more visual or not game breaking but it’s still frustrating to see. Also there’s a stealth system and a “awareness” system that are both good ideas but the execution on both is not quite perfect. Stealth is an interesting idea but you don’t have direct control over your units so sometimes you’ll make the right call but a unit will get caught on a corner or something and blow it. Overall if they iron out the bugs I think I’d call this more of a 8 but right now it needs to be Patched,Average

Decent story too but I just  at the beginning of the story, so hard to tell yet, have good it is exactly. I recommend to play NOT in story difficulty level, so you get some challenge from the aliens & really have to think, and level up & build your squad, & try out some different tactics, strategies when the aliens get really annoyed by your marine squad... :))) PS: To make the game less unforgiving, you can check the gameplay settings, so you can have more save slots. ;)",Positive

From buggy game mechanics to poor design choices, this game has left me feeling more frustrated than fulfilled. First and foremost, let's talk about the game's character stats system. This aspect of the game is simply infuriating. It seems as if you have to restart the game a million times just to get your desired character stats. This is not only a tedious process but also wastes a considerable amount of your valuable time which could be spent actually enjoying the game. Moreover, the spawn system of the game is unforgiving, leaving you in a dreadful loop of resource scarcity. There have been instances where I had to load a game state from 30 minutes ago because I used up all my loot, and nothing else was available on the map. This shatters any sense of immersion in the gameplay, as it forces you to keep going back in time due to poorly designed resource allocation. To make matters worse, the difficulty curve is unfairly punishing.

5251,"warhammer-40,000-boltgun",14-Dec-20,7,"I enjoyed the game, but it's not at all what was advertised. We were told it was going to be a deep RPG with immersion as good as RDR2, well that obviously didn't happen. It's buggy and glitchy, yes, and it doesn't run well for most people unless you have a NASA computer, but those things can be fixed and actually don't factor into my review of the game in the slightest. My biggest issue with the game is that it's entirely superficial, the world is big and looks beautiful but where are the things to do besides shooting people? I was expecting mini games, something like Gwent, or brain dances, hell, Wakako has a pachinko parlor, why can't we use it? Cutting hair, getting piercings, tattoos? None of it. Then there is the AI, and I can't believe a game released in 2020 with an AI system like this. The police outright spawn behind you, there is no chase system, no wanted system, no corrupt rich and powerful to send the police as their own personal hitmen, all things that were promised. Run away from the police after gaining a star? It's like they've never seen you before. But if you stand too close to them? They shoot you. There really isn't much things to do except things involving combat, and while combat is fun, it's not really all that fun to do it over and over again. I wanted to enjoy the city, not just the combat. Hacking is okay, but a little boring. Same with stealth. Personal story also has very little impact on the game, I remember they were planning to add in a whole ""traumatic life experiences"", ""childhood hero"" etc, but all of that got scrapped. It makes your beginning of nomad, corpo or street kid feel hollow except for the occasional dialogue option that honestly doesn't change much. And what was with the montage at the beginning? Why couldn't we experience those times with Jackie? Would've made him and events of the story surrounding him much more compelling since, ya know, we'd actually have time to get to know him. You could've showed us, not told us. Something I can say about the game though is that the characters are very well written. Honestly it's the cast that really drive this game, their growth and depth are really well done and CDPR did a great job of making me hate, then love, then love-hate, then love again a certain character. But I'm a little pissed extra special attention was given to Judy and Panam, while Kerry and River took the backseat by being entirely easy to miss by being tied to side quests, unlike our ladies. Give a little love to our homies, CDPR. Which also brings me to the point of why the heck did they censor all the dongs in the game? It was there in the tech demo. Full frontal nudity is okay for women, but not for men? Give me a break, this is a bleak as heck world, a scrapper wouldn't have the courtesy to leave a man's underwear on if they only viewed them as meat and valuable tech. I also want to bring up the endings, I won't spoil anything but I can say I don't particularly like any of them, and again, they favor the girl romances in certain endings. I really, really hate open ended endings that tease things ""oo, maybe a dlc? maybe not? maybe a 2nd title?"". It's lazy, annoying, and doesn't really give me a sense of closure.

The idea of mixing some platformer elements into this adventure game worked out well, but it lacks substance.

5292,dead-island-2,30-Jul-23,7,"Dead Island 2 is a game I was really hyped for, given how much I loved the original game in the series. It had constant action, numerous side quests, fun game mechanics, interesting character progression, a beautiful semi-open world, and high replayability. So far, I've spent 70 hours playing Dead Island 2. While it has been enjoyable overall, I can't deny feeling a bit disappointed with some aspects.Compared to Dead Island 1, there have been significant changes, especially with the playable characters. Now, there's a wider selection of characters, each with their unique skills, strengths, and weaknesses. The skill tree system has been replaced with a new skill card system, which I personally found to be a positive change. It allowed me to experiment with different playstyles and add more depth to my gameplay, thanks to features like the Autophage. Weapon customization has also been changed a lot, which allowed me to make really fun loadouts. The mid-game addition of using zombie parts to get even more special weapon customizations made this new change really interesting.The dialogues in the game are often hilarious and playful, filled with good one-liners. However, they started getting repetitive quite quickly, which took away some of the initial charm. The story itself didn't captivate me much, similar to Dead Island 1; it served its purpose in guiding me through the playthrough, but it wasn't particularly impactful. Still, I noticed that the story in Dead Island 2 was more intricate and structured compared to the first game. Additionally, the game offered more playable areas, although many of them were smaller than those in the first game. All of the old zombies are back, along with some new variations.One aspect that left me disappointed was the lack of replayability. Although there's a new character selection, Dead Island 2 lacks the ""new game plus"" feature like its predecessor. In the original game, starting a new playthrough with the same character, while retaining XP and weapons, added a lot to the game's longevity. Unfortunately, Dead Island 2 only provides a few post-story side quests, which isn't enough to keep the excitement alive. Furthermore, I found it frustrating that you receive legendary weapons in the late-game, but you can't carry them over to a new playthrough.The game is filled with bugs, and you'll probably encounter quite a few of them. From props and bodies clipping through the ground to missing geometry and zombies failing to pathfind, there were some noticeable issues. Although these bugs didn't significantly affect my gameplay, they were still pretty noticable.On a positive note, I'm impressed with how the playable areas turned out. Even though Dead Island 1 is a decade old game, Dead Island 2 managed to implement beautiful graphics. Many places are fully explorable, including the buildings. Sadly, a lot of exploration is stopped by random invisible walls.Meanwhile I understand some people might have found the next feature to be bad, but I found the way of going to other and older areas to find certain zombies holding keys to safes in other areas of the game to be fun. It added some replayability meanwhile trying to 100% the game. The game also includes co-op, which sadly I didn't try out so I cant leave a review about that, but I still believe it to be even more fun compared to the first game, since this game also includes some skill cards that are designed to be used in co-op in ways of support, defense, or offense.Overall, while Dead Island 2 has its strengths and enjoyable moments, it falls short in some areas, especially regarding replayability and bugs. However, the different playable characters and the well-designed areas make it a solid addition to the series. I hope to see some changes in the future to be included in updates, especially around replayability and quests.",Average
5293,dead-island-2,29-Jul-23,6,"Solid game, combat is visceral and gruesome just as a zombie game should be, story is meh but it's fun to hack up some zombies for a couple hours it gets tiresome after a while though, graphics are good with cool dismemberment not seen in other titles.

I'm definitely more invested than I was with dying light 2 but unfortunately nothing is blowing me away here it's very much a 6.5/10 sort of game.

Sometimes it feels restrictive, but you get used to those animations. Also, graphics in that context really adds to the experience, because hitting a zombie feels great. Mutilation is on point, and so is physics. Melee, as a gameplay core, is satisfying and all types of it are fun at some point. We also have elements like fire and electricity to modify and change our gameplay style. Fire guns feel Over Powered, but since ammo is not that easy to get all the time, you have to save it for important moments. About the graphics, it's really impressive. Even in 1080p ultra, the game feels photorealistic. LA is amazing. Day or Night, doesn't matter. Facial expressions are pretty good, even though, let's be honest, the script didn't use them to their full potential. But talking about physics, hands down to the amazing water we have high here. Remember the elements I said before? They match perfectly with the gasoline, water, and chemical resources we find on the map. For example, you can get a gallon of water, spread it all over the ground, and hit it with an electricity weapon to kill a horde of zombies. Or use water to clean the chemical that is in your way. it's beautiful and hella fun.",Average
5298,dead-island-2,24-Jul-23,4,"This game had so much potential. I really desperately wanted to like it, but.... it was terrible. Pros:-looks good-killing zombies is a fun concept-weapon crafting Cons:-weapons constantly break. I cannot stress how overwhelmingly annoying this is. Weapons break after a dozen swings. I find a great weapon, I love it, I kill two zombies, and it's gone. WHAT? WHY? Who thought this would be a good idea? It's infuriating. I hate it so much, words cannot express how annoyed I am. If I found out someone drove to a Dead Island 2 developer's house and punched him in the face for designing this stupid breaking weapon system, I'd understand. -Super buggy and glitchy game play -Invisible walls in the design. For example when I first started playing I came across this streamer house called the Goat Pen. Certain rooms of the house were locked, requiring access cards to unlock them. It's basically like a lame scavenger hunt. Okay, fine.... I searched around the house for the keys. The only thing is... they weren't there. What? No keys? I googled the location of the keycard I needed ""Goat pen master key."" It was supposed to be on a table in the master bedroom, only it wasn't there. What? Why not? What is even happening? I thought it was a glitch or something. NOPE. They intentionally programmed the game so you can't get the keys until you reach a certain level, but they dont tell you that. So you're just stuck. WHY? What moron decided this would be a good idea? -Combat feels terrible. Hit boxes are awful. There's no logic behind damage. A super massive, slow swinging sword does less damage than a fast-attacking stick. What? Why? It's so painful to play. Dead Island 2 is like taking a great car and putting square wheels on it. This game could have been spectacular, but the horrificly stupid design decisions ruined it. I just want to know, who did this?",Negative

There's no explanation why the main character got the immune power. Everything seems to be put together forcefully for the entire story. The customization is too limited. Weapon types does not matter,. For example, a sword or a pole-arm basically does the same moveset, same attack speed and same damage. It just reskins as another weapon with no obvious purpose. There's also no reason to keep playing after finishing the main campaign since there's nothing interested, no boss fight, no harder enemies. Grahpics are very nice though.",Average
5301,dead-island-2,20-Jul-23,4,"Its hard to describe why this game is sadly such a massive lost opertunity. The game is basically almost the exact same as the first one, except it looks and performs really nice thanks to Unreal Engine 4. They really did a good job getting stunning graphics out of it. The fighting system to me felt to slow and sluggish at first but when I got used to it it feels really nice. The problem with the game: 1. Weapon spam and auto adjusting level of everything makes the game kind of boring. Its mostly too easy, until you suddenly face a hard enemy but when you die you just respawn, no loading screen nice but the game lacks any real challange and is more like a arcade sandbox playground. But the world is not really open world and not big and interesting enough for that. You get spammed with weapons,  selling what is in your ""no claimed"" items locker is a pain in the ass as you need to move it to normal locker and from there to your inventory and then go to the trader. This is so tiresome and annoying to manage. You just get too many weapons, like 1/4 into the game they do NEVER BREAK because you just have a entire wheel to switch to. Throwing them does way to less damage to be worth it. And the rarity system is laughable. You just get rare items on the regular demanding on how far you are in the story. You can level up your weapons, that makes you just sell **** to level up your weapons you like. Its more or less a pointless annoying system IMO. Characters are far worse then in the first game. The first game captured me so much more. Story is not funny, but characters are total cringefest cliche ones. You are too powerful. You have tons of deadly weapons, and later even guns that make it just a walk in the park. You have two things to throw and instead having them on 2 different buttons the game is so utterly stupid that you have one button to switch and one to throw. Who came up with the stupid idea. Its like mind boggling stupid. it feels like they intended to give you even more at a time. So and of that all is not enough you have fury mode that turns you into a total god that just kills everything. The game lacks the interesting or challenging things or could have to actually justify this power. But its more like a playground. Many different cards that change some abilities and damage and health buffs but look like more then they actually are. The game could have been so much more. Given the first game was more or less the same, a mindless zombie slasher that was just fun and not really challenging but for some reason back then it was just more fun. It maybe that I aged that ads to the that but ... i really find it sad this game is basically a worse version of the game with better graphics. There is no island! The first game had cars, this one does not. It took them so long to finish this game and its essentially nothing more then a graphics upgrade. Some zombies are immune to some of your weapons, a lost opportunity to make you actually force to use different weapons for different areas, enemies. its usually just one or two and you just switch weapon or kill them with any of your other OP things you have. They could have evolved the game into something more and of not that, at least make the story and characters better. The world looks way to pretty to be waste with such a mediocre game. Lets talk about all these locked things everywhere? WTF? I do not think I opened a single lockbox yet and I already finished the game and did some sidequests. I even searched areas. Speaking of searching, these stupid search ring quests get on my nerves in EVERY video game, but especially here. And you can not clear areas, the zombies respawn constantly so you well never EVER get your silence to search in peace for something, that I find a major annoyance for some of the quests you get. Its fun for a while the fun could last longer then just finishing the game. I do not feel like playing another character or doing boring quests now. I also had a bug that I lost ""Emmas wreath"" the weapon you get on the end of teh story and I read people call it the best weapon in the game. Apart from this the game seems relatively bug free and actually mature technically, sadly something that it less and less nowadays. Games often get released in a bugfest stage, apart from that bug I did not notice anything. Lets talk multiplayer: Why the F is there no server browser? I can only play with friends or just randomly just some game. If I do not want to play with one guy and leave and rejoin, it puts me in the game game again. I like the system that it puts you with people with your story progression and hat you both continue the story but you also should be able to join any game you like. This system is stupid. It seems to force people to play with friends or that ONE single game the game assigns to you at the game. BAD system. So not 2023!

5318,dead-island-2,28-May-23,3,"I completed 22 out of the 24 game missions (total of 50% of all the game content completed) and am ready to review the game. Let's start with the good stuff:Weapon animations are good.Mission design is entertaining and there's even some decent voice acting.Quick join option to jump into the action for co-op.Now for the not-so-good stuff:No voice chat options of any kind, no ability to type to teammates (I guess the main focus is a console release but even then. they usually have built-in voice options) and very limited emotes are available. Good luck communicating with your teammates.A very difficult game to solo. Two characters have low resilience, which means they'll die very quickly when exposed to elemental and environmental dangers (Jason and Dani). The ones that have medium resilience have low hit points and toughness (Amy and Bruno). That leaves the two tanks as the best solo options for end-game content. This is far less of an issue if you have a decent team (so you're not soloing)  but with limited communication options it's very hit-or-miss.There are often a massive amount of zombies to defeat at mandatory mission checkpoints as the game progresses and they'll keep spawning all over the place. In some areas when you die and restart in the area it wipes all of your progress up to the last autosave and penalizes you by not restoring any of the medpacks you used during the previous attempt, reducing your chance of success on that tough missions you nearly completed. Now imagine trying and failing that mission a dozen times and you'll see how frustrating this can be. If you're playing Amy or Bruno, you are going to struggle even more as you get close to the game finale. Jason and Dani will melt from all of the environmental damage that becomes a frequent factor on every map (especially the instanced ones that don't restore your medkits.If you're going to spend the money on this game, start with Ryan and maybe Carla as your first solo character. Dani or Jason are very strong to start but the environmental damage will make your life hell later on.The Epic launcher didn't even let me uninstall the game so I ended up having to wipe the launcher to remove it from my PC.

Most of the time you will be just enjoying brutal combat and fore filled zombie slaying. Whole combat system, leveling up, getting perks, upgrading weapons is really well balanced. The best of it all is the enviromental aspect of killing as you can lay different traps etc. Setting and graphics are superb as the missions during the day are followed by those during the night, which can be truly atmospheric. Whole game is really well optimised, which is kind of a miracle these days. Story itself is pretty cheesy and generic, but that's not the selling point of the game.

At the better state that's just an open beta that u pay $60.",Negative
5326,dead-island-2,19-May-23,7,"TL;DR: Wanted to give it a 6.5 but I'm unable to. Far better than Dying Light 2, but not better than Dead Island 1/Riptide. Long version: After literally going through a decade of development hell & several different dev teams, it's finally here. Graphically: it's gorgeous. Performance-wise: never noticed Denuvo, A with the occasional stuttering here and there, barely felt. Definitely a vast improvement over Dying Light 2 in every way. That one I couldn't play more than 1 hour before refunding. This one, I started feeling the urge to stop playing late in the game when I was close to the finale (though I didn't know I was yet). You don't play these games for the story, you play them to kill zombies. And that is what DI2 makes super-fun. The Good: The visual gore system has been upgraded to look even better than Dying Light 1. You start slashing away and you see different layers of gore coming through with each slash. First you see the dead flesh parting, and with the 2nd and 3rd slash the disembowelment begins, with the guts starting to spill out. You shoot a zombie in the neck & watch the head tumble off like a bowling pin. THAT is fun! Level design is fantastic from start to finish, as you move from LA 'burb to 'burb and see the changing levels of visual luxury, complete with an awesome-looking ""social media influencer mansion"" containing an official apology script. Hilarious, and accurate. Enemy variety is also a plus! You have multiple types of common enemies: the shambling slow, the average movers & the runners, and several variations of those with a little extra punch. Some of the Specials return (the Ram is missing) and a few new ones have been added. Performance & combat smoothness is just great. This is a very polished game. Like I said above, Denuvo didn't seem to affect my gameplay in the slightest, and never experienced any crashing. The card system is interesting in that it makes you focus on exploration, and it can easily make you sink 25 hours into your first playthrough. It also provides you with bonus melee powers for nicely customizable hand-to-hand combat. And guns! Guns everywhere, after you reach a certain early point in the story. Firearm combat is smooth and satisfying, although the gun variety is fairly basic. You get a couple different shotguns, a couple different handguns, a few different rifles, etc. Weapon crafting has been improved, there are many more mods this time around. Several also have very situational bonuses that help you maximize your time spent out in the world without having to run back and forth to a safe location. You also have multiple survivors to choose from, each with their own unique personality & attributes. Dialogue & banter can go from silly to cliched to downright hilarious. The Bad: My 1st biggest gripe is also the same gripe that plagues Dying Light 1: the lack of environmental variety. There are no Acts/Chapters here, and you're stuck in the same cluster of areas for the entire game, just like you're stuck in Harran from start to finish. What made Dead Island 1 & Riptide so awesome is the environmental variety between Acts. You go from the picturesque beach and the lifehouse to the gloomy slums of Port Moresby, then you go through the jungle to reach the prison island. Then from that you fight for your freedom on board a military ship (loved that) and end up on another island, fight through the coastal town to get to the ruins in the middle of the jungle to find the sewers, etc etc. All that environmental variety adds a huge amount of replayability. It keeps boredom at bay because you're always moving from place to place, and gives you a true sense of progress. Sadly that's not present in DI2. There's a bit too much back & forth required story-wise for my liking, and each ""suburb"" is quite small. It also lacks a proper day/night cycle. The story back & forth I mentioned adds a small element of it, giving the illusion of ""passage of time"". For example when you leave Beverly Hills it's night time. When you get back to it to progress the story, it's daytime. The gun sounds are also not the best, they sound a bit hollow. Dead Island 1/Riptide got it right in that department. And speaking of sound, this leads us to my 2nd biggest gripe: the same Sound bug that plagued the releases of both Dead Island 1 & Riptide. The sound bug that greatly reduces overall game world sound. You can barely hear the ambience, the zombies or yourself. Not even the Loudness Equalization setting of my sound card made any difference. Deep Silver has a long bad history of hiring **** sound designers. I had to use Letasoft Sound Booster and set it to +350% in order to match the volume level the game SHOULD have. Conclusion: Dead Island 2 is definitely worth playing through once, just to get it out of your system after this insanely long wait. But it just doesn't have the replayability of its predecessors.",Average

5329,dead-island-2,14-May-23,8,"The game is fun to play full of the atmosphere and jump scares that make you feel like your in a zombie apocalypse, the initial sandbox is a good ramp up into the mechanics of the game. The environments are good and they keep the areas to a size where you are never feeling lost or like you are churning through the same combat encounters over and over. All in all a solid zombie game with some good story driven narrative, being forced to be melee only for a significant chunk of the game was fun. The games difficulty ramps up over time with new zombie classes but so do your abilities. So it keeps things feeling fresh throughout the game. Some of the bits I thought could of been better is more persistence but you can hand wave some of that away with your own narrative oh a zombie came and messed with that or whatever. But you can definitely tell that entities within the level get reset and respawned once you go outside a certain area / radius and return to find them back in their initial state. Some things are persistent and its sometimes that inconsistency that makes you take a second glance. All in all great game with good atmosphere I've put about 30 hours into and I can see myself sinking at least about 30 if not more as I try to collect everything. Bugs I found: Some quests disappear after quitting and loading and can't be restarted or completed",Positive

The gore is so incredibly amazing, and it has to be the best gore system in any game released so far.

Zombies spawning constantly everywhere makes what exploration is available impossible. Eventually gave up and just got from a to b as quickly as possible. Buggy as hell too, how many times a Zombie in the distance suddenly appeared right in my face and trying to manage and sell weapon inventory was completely glitched. Environmental aspects were interesting but they're everywhere! Cant go more than a few steps without electrocution/fire/chemical areas, too many! Weapons upgrading feels pointless and inventory too restricted. Oh, and no driving!  It just doesn't have the scale, the soul or the freedom of the original DI where you could go where you wanted do what you wanted, plan your tactics, hone your skills,  clear an area (and know it was clear!) and take time to explore, look around and discover. None of this is possible in DI2, It's cramped, rushed, congested and confusing.",Average
5343,dead-island-2,3-May-23,9,"Dead Island 2 is better than it has any right to be, after years of delays and multiple different developers I went in expecting very little and boy was I wrong.The first thing you'll notice is that the game runs great, after so many terrible PC ports as of late it was extremely refreshing to play a game that looks incredible, with some of the best asset quality I've ever seen, whilst also performing brilliantly. With an RTX 3080 & 13700K I was able to hit a locked 120fps at native 1440p, and a locked 120fps at 4K with FSR 2.0 on the balanced preset, this was on max settings as well. I did crash maybe 5-6 times though, so hopefully that's fixed. One of the big highlights of the game is the new F.L.E.S.H system,  it's without a doubt the best gore system I have ever witnessed, it's disgusting and beautiful. Zombies peel like an onion, first their clothes and skin, then muscle and fat and finally bone, everything can be hacked and slashed. The slow motion and special kills really show the system off the best.Dead Island 2 has a big focus on melee combat but you do unlock guns further into the campaign, and both have a role to play. I saved my firearms for bosses and tougher enemies as ammo can be a little sparse. You can add mods to any weapon and there's a ton of them, you'll never be using the same weapon type for long (but you can if you want to, you can match any weapon with your level if you find one you love). Adding mods also changes the guns look, which I thought was a nice touch.The devs have done a fantastic job building the world, everything looks great and there's a ton of flare and attention to detail, whether you're in a hospital, police station or shopping mall, every area is packed full of little details that make it feel lived in during better times.I only played as Jacob but his voice actor did a very good job, and the script wasn't too cringe with some truly funny one liners.Overall the game is just fun and it's put together well, with no major performance issues, bugs or stutter. It's a big upgrade over the original and I'd put it on the same level as Dying Light 1, so if you enjoy that series I'm confident you'll enjoy Dead Island 2.",Positive

5350,dead-island-2,2-May-23,8,"TLDR: 8/10 very average game, but shines in key areas to be a fantastic buy. Great combat systems, underwhelming gunplay, skill cards are not the best decision, fantastic world design and surprisingly good writing. Dead Island 2 is a game that has been trapped in development hell and went through several studio's hands which would lead you to believe that the game has conflicting visions and would be a mess. But this is game is surprisingly average and I played on PC and Xbox Series X. The performance is fantastic on the low-end and on the high-end (5th Gen Ryzen 7, RTX 3080, 32GB of DDR4 RAM). Xbox Series X sees a stable 60FPS with a settings profile that is similar to PC high. The melee combat is fantastic with a good variety of weapons and upgrades, but that gets tiring by the end-game with nothing too fantastical to match the game's tone. The skill card system IS rewarding, but is not as good as Dead Island 1 and Riptide's skill tree. There is build variety, but the individual cards aren't that exciting. Think Fallout NV compared to Fallout 4. The crafting system is fine and it reminds you of early 2010's crafting systems, so not too overwhelming and not too exciting. The game is very lean, but that is a good thing for me. Not too much to get overwhelmed by, but it can be underwhelming if you expect it to match modern AAA games. The story is serviceable, but is expanded by the smart writing. Don't go in expecting a masterpiece or even a Dying Light 2 story, but go in expecting a simple story like Sunset Overdrive. Maximum fun, and minimum filler. 8/10 game with some downsides, but I enjoyed it and it's pleasantly average.",Positive

However, as the story progresses, it becomes draining. Despite initial promises of new weapons, skills, and mechanics, the game fails to deliver. The lackluster story took me around 15 hours to complete, even with half the side quests. The experience soured as I played, especially considering the buildup and disappointing ending. The story offers little variety, with only a few climactic moments that fail to make it worthwhile. The side missions suffer from extreme repetition, mainly consisting of mindless 'kill'em all' quests that I never want to do again. To make matters worse, the enemies you encounter are nearly identical, with no changes besides their names.

This is everything I had hoped for. Slight improvements to the original with some new features. Improvements in audio feedback (sound of some hammers cracking bones sounds MIGHTY). I literally haven't felt fun in games for the last 5 or 6 years and here I am now completely blown away. I had a zombie's lower arm hang by its muscle earlier and flop around.

I mean, the story's a snoozefest, the characters ain't cringey and actually kinda alright, but the quests? Totally boring. Run here, chat with this dude, go all Rambo on 'em, rinse and repeat. Fun for an hour, but then it's just a drag. The combat system's got some chops, but those scripted zombie takedowns? Locked animations, invincibility, and they just kill the vibe. Now, about the ranged weapons, they're pretty weak sauce compared to the melee stuff. Sure, they pack a punch and can off enemies in no time, but other than that? They're like playin' with toy guns. The gun feedback (sound design, recoil, handling), It's like it ain't even there. And then the loading screens and lack of open world. I can deal with no massive open world, but loading screens? The biggest bummer, though, is the jacked-up zombie spawning. These freaks just pop up outta nowhere, even when you're backed up against a wall. They still manage to be behind you out of nowhere. It's like they took notes from Cyberpunk's wonky police spawning. And the boss fights? More like bullet sponges with the same moves, I'm not kidding, mostly all of them have the same mechanics, well maybe sometimes they spit out fire instead of green crap. That's how much variation you get. The ending is super dull and doesn't do the story any favors. If they fix the spawning, it's a solid 5/10 or a 6/10. But man, what a letdown after waiting so long for it to be released. The only thing that is very positive is that the game is mostly bug free and really pretty. The game got definitely its moments but it's not enough to justify the price or a higher score.",Average

5378,dead-island-2,24-Apr-23,10,"I recently played Dead Island 2 and I had a blast with the game. As a fan of zombie games, I was excited to see the game set in California, which is one of my favourite places. The game manages to create a similar feeling to the original Dead Island, but with a more comic-horror twist. One of the best things about Dead Island 2 is the level system, which is quite cool. You feel like you're making progress as you level up, and it adds an extra layer of satisfaction to the game. Another great feature is the Fury ability, where you're able to go into fury mode and become a zombie for a while. This was a really fun aspect of the game and added an extra dimension to the gameplay. I found Dead Island 2 to be very fresh and polished, and I didn't encounter any bugs that ruined the gameplay or made it unfun. The game is incredibly realistic, especially with the gore system, which is one of the best I've seen in a video game. The dismemberment of zombies is wild and satisfying to see. I loved that I could switch out my skill cards and change up the game a bit, and the abilities like Dodge were really fun to use. The challenging missions were also enjoyable, and I had a great time playing through them. Overall, I think Dead Island 2 is a cool game that offers a lot of entertainment. Dambuster Studio has proven that they are good at making zombie games, and I appreciate the effort put into the game's details. I would definitely recommend this game to any fans of zombie games looking for a fun and challenging experience.",Positive

5383,dead-island-2,24-Apr-23,9,"Dead Island 2 does nothing to reinvent the wheel. BUT.... that wheel has been finely polished and spins like a champ. This is a zombie hack and slash video game that doesn't take it's story to seriously and neither should you. Reviews from the critics seem like they are hating on the game for the sole reason that they themselves, may be from Hell-A (LA) where the game draws many stereotypes for its characters. The one thing I believe the game does very well at the beginning is to slowly introduce more mechanics instead of throwing everything at you all at once which keeps you entertained for longer. Personally, I have mainly co-oped the game (progress saved for both parties) but single player is doable. Pros: Weapon mechanics, crafting system, resources are plentiful yet restricted (different areas for different things), items are where you would expect them to be, whoever initiates quest is the main voice of a cutscene (this is a personal preference), awesome counter attacks for stunned zombies, GORE SYSTEM IS AMAZING, enough ammo for guns but not enough to make it all you use, very detailed locations and environmental story telling, smooth 60 fps, crisp graphics, story is entertaining enough, special zombies hold keys, and countless other minor things. Cons:  Co-op kicks randomly at times, to many caustic ( electric, fire, and acid) hazards in the world at times, weapons can cause caustic damage to you when zombies catch, shotguns a little to weak or should maim more, not 100% open world (which may have lead to better location designs), characters are good but no strong attachments are built for most characters (one mission and done), Special zombies have the same attacks over and over which just make them tedious, zombies now crawl out of vents or storm drains which can take away from immersion. To end this, I believe personally too many people have come into video games demanding excellence and not just slowing themselves down while putting the real world behind them and JUST HAVE FUN.  Thls game has been through development hell but I don't care about that. I care about finished products. You know what to expect if you like videogames like these. You can watch the trailers and see whether it is something you would like or not. If you bought it knowing you may not like it, you may want to critique yourself and make some changes. You know what you are getting with Dead Island 2 and the developers haven't lead people to believe it would be anything else. 8.4 out of 10. Rounded up is a 9 (Played on Series X)",Positive

Also i hate when electrical zombies are 100% immune to electric weapons (i dont think electricity i cutting limbs with electric sword). +1 point for Unreal Engine implementation and at least RT Off. Even FSR isnt needed with graphic better than CP77/Dying Light 2. There are small maps but still its better way. Dynamic lightning without good static is today is dumb. Please Nvidia make good static lightning cache solutions not blurry AI, denoising, unaccurate pathtracing with single bounce.

You can choose from a different range of characters, its NOT fully open world. As it has loading screens to travel through LA.With that said this doesn’t mean the game is bad. The (small) open(kinda)  world bit is still very enjoyable as the loading screens are in huge military control points that were used when the city went into lockdown, so its not bad. Dying Light fans(like myself!) will struggle with this game a little as there is no way to run away from the big variety of zombies. You will have to think fast and plan traps with fire, acid and water. The last one will have to be used with a weapon with electrical perks. The puzzles are not complex at all and are made to be simple. Take here, put there, follow this person, BOSS. Pretty simple. The level system is pretty straightforward. There is no Skill Tree, the perks are assigned by level and then they can be chosen to be played in slots or not, its up to the playerAll and all, the game is a 9 out of 10.

There is only 9 MOBS, 9!!! 2 at the begining and everytime you kill a boss (even though there is no challenge when fighting them), it becomes a common mob you see occasionaly. The difficulty system is non existant, I died more times while getting team killed by my coop member than by zombies.Equipement is underwhelming, at first glance, you think there is a lot of weapon. But actualy there is like 50 different weapons ( swords, knifes, pistols, uzi etc... ) and then all of them are re skins.The item rarity is really bad. At the beginning you are thrilled to get a green weapon, but as soon as you get one, you almost get exclusively green or better items and so on. The fact that you can equalize you weapons level means that after you get a single item you like in purple rarity you don't need any other.The sound is horrible, the spacialization of the sound is the worst I have ever seen in a modern video game.Now, for the final boss. 30 sec top chrono, the cinematic before it was longer than the fight it was just deceiving.",Negative

Story is okay, graphics are okay but not worth the price. 9 differents zombies, every boss is just a normal monster afterwards making it just repetitive.

Though the game is designed to be linear and in districts, every district feels enormous and I always find myself doubling back to places I forgot had initially existed. The interiors and exteriors of buildings are so intricately detailed and designed. The environment is top notch. Almost every surface will react with effects from enemies and weapons such as fire, electrify, and water. The story is pretty light hearted and a bit goofy, but still entertaining.  It's not a masterpiece,  but it's exactly what it sets out to be.",Positive
5399,dead-island-2,22-Apr-23,7,"DI2 has good potential, but far too many unfortunate faults plagued my playthrough. There's a bit of fun in the guns, weapon variety and environmental chaos that can ensue, especially with friends. The few skills you can mix and match to find something appealing to you individually is nice, but it lacks any real depth in the form of skill trees and or perks to really effect how you deal damage to the undead, or assist your co-op partners. Would be nice to see more co-op perks, passives like increased damage with blades or guns, anything, just to give me a solid way to play with the weapons I like. The level design is refreshing and fun, there's a lot of environmental things to experiment with. In the first few hours, the scenery and time of day change multiple times with fast-paced music beatdowns, interesting boss arenas here and there, and good environmental storytelling throughout. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't having fun with the first two major boss fights. The story is fine, but after about the 3-4 hour mark, it (and the combat) can quickly loose it's luster. Animation-locked combat animations will still allow other enemies to damage you while you're stuck doing a ""glory"" kill move from the trailers. A fitting game to admire the impressive gore system, but little else makes it stand out in the horde of similar zombie titles. There's no run and hide mechanic, or stealth takedowns, such mechanics obviously aren't required in every zombie game, but it could provide some variety to handling the many encounters that start to feel rather repetitive late-game. Environmental traversal is lacking and one can never truly clear a map 'stage' area due to zombies constantly spawning in somewhere on the map, which can make backtracking to find gear or collectables a chore in the fairly-limited, linear stages. There is a leveling system, but the enemies scale with individual level (solo) so no matter where one goes, the same leveled combat constantly follows. Earlier stages, expected to be easily cleared again due to having higher powered weapons from later on in the game, remain stagnant in difficulty, with no slider in the game settings, for more challenging or easier encounters. If you can stomach the frustratingly fun combat and mild story of Dead Island 2, give it a try,",Average

5408,dead-island-2,22-Apr-23,6,"Long awaited and, sadly, disappointing sequel to a pretty good game Pros:Keeps DIY customization for weapons allowing custom elemental effects and boostsGood use of environmental hazards to use to difficult the player or to aid themNot open world, but big chunks of map to explore and backtrack for more items, loot or missionsNew types of boss zombiesThe new visuals are stunningThe narrative is not new or groundbreaking, but 6 hrs in and still interesting. Also refferences to DI1 are aprecciated! Cons:Zombies are no longer pre-placed in a site, now the spawn, sometimes in the cone of vision of the player or behing them, making the fights unfair a large amount of timeThe boss zombies are damage sponges and the fights are all the same, making necessary to spam click and block, trying not to die from the smaller zombies that spawns continuously behind your backDriving? Nah, 6hr in and not a single usable vehicleLess variety of environmental puzzles like DI1, reducing them only to ""need fusible/battery/valve wheel to proceed"" The game is fun to play, but clearly is not worth this price, and even tho it took so long to finish, clearly feels like it needed more time",Average

5410,9-years-of-shadows,24-Jun-23,7,"Достаточно спорная вещь. Не думаю, что я решусь когда-нибудь переиграть, но по большей части было приятно.В итоге могу сказать, что для дебютной работы 9 Years of Shadows очень хороша. Не без своих неудачных решений, спорных механик и необходимости править техническую часть Это отличное приобретение для ценителей жанра метроидваний.",Average
5411,9-years-of-shadows,14-May-23,2,"9 Years of Shadows is a metroidvania like that tries to inovate the genre, but kind of fails. The lore its misterious, but boring. The usual gameplay its different, but not good as the classics. You dont have a level system, so doesnt make any sense to fight enemys, just avoid them. And they are all repetitive, besides there are no intelligence at all, you can learn their pattern in 2 or 3 moves. The game emphasizes the colour as a major importance in the story, but the color palette is extremely flat with no contrast at all. The quests are useless, with dialogs that doent sum up to anything. The life system its strange to get use to, you have a life/energy bar that you need to use to fire your power but drains your life. And there are a lot of copy content in the game, not inspirations, copies! The elevator animations its just like samus, the armor are just like golden knights from Saint Seiya, even a boss named Andros Mask (stars fox just sayed hello here). Again, I see some critics praising this game for beeing ""beatiful"" and not broken, but for this are a basic need for a game exist and I feel that just not worth my time playing.",Negative
5412,9-years-of-shadows,18-Apr-23,9,"This is an amazing experience. The gameplay runs pretty smoothly, the story is well-thought-out, the music is masterfully made. It was a great power trip to go from nothing to something in a classic metroidvania.",Positive
5413,9-years-of-shadows,15-Apr-23,10,"Although is a short game, what the games offers is a classic experience that reminded me a lot of Aria of Sorrow and Megaman Zero. The music is phenomenal and the backgrounds are breathtaking.",Positive
5414,9-years-of-shadows,14-Apr-23,10,"Short, fun & pretty metroidvania. 9 Years of Shadows is a nice and focused on the basics of a tight Metroidvania which goes great for what they want to show. This is the Lo-fi Metroidvania I didn´t know I wanted.",Positive
5415,9-years-of-shadows,14-Apr-23,10,"This game is a ""back to basic"" metroidvania but in a totally good way. It feels like a really old game brought to the present. It's vibrant, lively and it's easy to pick up on the game mechanics quickly. The gameplay is smooth, the cutscenes are very well done. The animation is amazing, the way Europa's dress seems to flow is stunning.",Positive
5416,9-years-of-shadows,30-Mar-23,10,"9 Years of Shadows is one of the best sweet metroidvanias I have played in a while. The feeling of this game is like playing Metroid Fusion back in the day. The game is clustered in key areas and the level design guides the player towards the next goal without making the player feel lost or too much straightforward.While the combat is a bit simple, it's a highlight of the game because you can combine the combos and it allows the same cancels as any Castlevania game. With the cancels, you can make infinte combos to any boss making a TON of damage, leading to satisfying moments when you connect them well.In addition to the gameplay, the game looks phenomenal, even comparing with others like Blasphemous. The soundtrack shows that was made by Michiru Yamane and Norihiko Hibino.The only problem I think this game has is that is a little too short... but overall, 9 Years of Shadows was one of the best surprises the player had in quite a while.",Positive
5417,9-years-of-shadows,12-Apr-23,8,"The highlights of this game are the music and the art style. This game is a fun Metroidvania that won't take too much of your time to get through, there are some moments where the game feels a bit easy with unexpected difficulty spikes for bosses. The devs were very clear about where there inspiration came from and you feel it in world and design.",Positive
5418,9-years-of-shadows,7-Apr-23,2,"It's a simple metroidvania... it's not a big deal. Although visually it is beautiful, it lacks substance, lack of narrative, NPCs that do not imply much in the gameplay, the fights with the bosses are good but the rest of the enemies are REPETITIVE, they only change their appearance, it even encourages you to evade them when you are already stronger something that is a shame since a lot of gameplay is lost, its duration is short something that should not be a problem in a metroidvania but this game does not invite to be replayable for something as simple as the narrative, good metroidvania but it simply does not convince me buy it day one. better to wait for a good offer, I leave aside the occasional small bug since it is irrelevant.",Negative
5419,9-years-of-shadows,7-Apr-23,3,"Es un metroidvania Si...... Pero le falta la raiz como la historia que brilla por su ausencia. si bien los ataques son algo entretenidos no hay motivacion por seguir adelante, vamos que es lo basico de un metroid o castlevania clasico, ni siquiera hacia falta una cinematica sino contexto. No esperen algo sorprendente que les atraiga rejugarlo. Solo jueguenlo una vez y listo. No hara falta nada mas",Negative
5420,9-years-of-shadows,4-Apr-23,9,"9 Years of Shadows is an incredible game. The art is stunning!The soundtrack is fantastic.

Besides this… the game play is dynamic with a fun interaction with the armors and a lovely bear. What about the music? Man… THE MUSIC!

For me, the best thing about this game is the attention to detail in every hand-crafted scenery, and its great story. The things that the developers could improve are the difficulty and the mechanics of the non-boss enemies. So if you're looking for a new game to play, give this one a try - you won't be disappointed!",Positive

5429,lego-2k-drive,25-May-23,10,One of The best game releases in this year. Every other game had horrible performance issues and this is so far the best game you can play in 2023. Story is really funny with typical Lego game humor. Biggest point for me is that this game has only 10 GB. It’s smallest AAA game I’ve seen in a while. Absolutely recommend this for PS5 as a gift for a children or fans of racing games. So far I didn’t had any issues with game on PC. I have more issues with forza horizon 5 which is 2 years old game than with this release and that says much about state of this game.,Positive
5430,lego-2k-drive,23-May-23,2,While the game and gameplay itself is awesome!!!! This is an outrageous cash grab!!!!! Overpriced in ingame cash but also in real money!! Beware!!,Negative
5431,lego-2k-drive,21-May-23,1,"Dads beware! This not so bad game has only one purpose. Make money with your kids. It's very grind-heavy, the in-game shop has multiple currencies to make everything absolutely diffuse for the kids.The game itself is good, but much too short. Just enough to motivate you to buy something. Terrible business methods.",Negative
5432,lego-2k-drive,21-May-23,8,"While Lego 2K Drive is a very good game, I just don't live the Season Pass because it can likely ruin the potential the game has. But it has very solid gameplay and could be better if not for the season pass. But overall, it is a very fun racing game.",Positive
5433,lego-2k-drive,20-May-23,0,"This abomination needs to be shutdown. The precedent that 2K/Lego are trying to present here is appalling. A **LEGO** racing game that at first glance you would think would be amazing for children and families alike. Perhaps an awesome alternative to Mario Kart that isn’t restricted to Nintendo. But then you see it’s overpriced price tag, and think wow this must be an awesome premium game right? Lol nope, this is not only overpriced, BUT also incorporates microtransactions AND a battle pass system. “B-but it’s just cosmetics” the defenders will say, but limiting the creativity of customisation in a game rated for children is horrendously stupid if not borderline illegal. Don’t waste your time with this game if 2K/Lego don’t value you and your wallet. It’s a shame as the gameplay definitely has some substance but feels more like an early access, than an actual complete game. Perhaps due to the decision to make this into what appears to be a live service game.",Negative
5434,layers-of-fear,21-Jun-23,10,"This is great horror game, looks to be the best of 2023. The art of storytelling has a great power, it makes us feel bad when we finish playing because of what it brings.",Positive

And also you can walk forever until you find a scrap of mirror. Nice feature!!!Don't buy it really. Download it from torrent if you really wanna just test this.
